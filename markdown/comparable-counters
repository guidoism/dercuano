For generating PWM waveforms, it would be nice to have a state machine
design that could expand to larger registers without increasing its
depth.  Synchronous ripple carry has O(N) depth, while lookahead carry
has O(log N) depth, but designs with O(1) depth include ring counters,
LFSRs, and Johnson counters.  However, those three cases have
disadvantages: ring counters require N bits to represent N states,
while Johnson counters are almost as bad, requiring N/2.  LFSRs are
nearly optimal in flip-flop efficiency and can always work with depth
of one or slightly more, but comparing LFSR states for beforeness is
very difficult.  In some cases it may be adequate to compare the LFSR
state for equality.

Carry-save counters have depth of 1, but it is also not clear to me
that they can be compared for greaterness with any reasonable degree
of circuit depth.  Also, they use twice as many bits as a regular
binary counter, and while this isnâ€™t as bad as a Johnson counter, it's
significantly bad.

The context of all of this is that it would be nice to have counters
that we can clock very quickly.
