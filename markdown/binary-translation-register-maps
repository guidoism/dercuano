Reading Sorav Bansal’s dissertation, I was struck by the fact
that in the middle of the binary-translation section, he tackles the
register allocation problem using the Viterbi algorithm, although he
seems not to have realized that he was solving register allocation
(conventionally considered NP-hard) or that his solution was the
Viterbi algorithm.

The context is not conventional compiler code generation but rather
binary translation from PowerPC code to 386 code, so both the input
and output of his system are sequences of instructions.  He is faced
with the question of how to assign registers for the output
instructions.

His solution is to compute the cost of all possible register maps, one
input instruction at a time, as he walks through the input code,
adding an extra “switching cost” when the predecessor state used a
different register map; but he retains only the lowest-cost few maps
at any given point in order to keep the cost reasonable, up to about 8
maps, though he only gets a significant performance advantage up to
about 3 maps.  (I wonder if this is due to having several maps that
are essentially equivalent.)

This seems like a remarkably simple approach to a remarkably difficult
problem, so simple that I am led to wonder whether it actually works.
Some other aspects of the scholarship in the dissertation are shaky.
