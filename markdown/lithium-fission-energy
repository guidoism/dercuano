The result was an extra 10 megatons of yield (4.2e16 joules, i.e. 42
petajoules) from the 10.7 tonnes of the device, most of which was
presumably the lithium; this is about 6 or 7 petajoules per kg.

This reaction is remarkably similar to the “energy amplification”
reaction used in thorium reactors: a neutron entering a mass of
lithium-7 will stimulate a decay, which emits another neutron, which
is either lost or stimulates another decay, and so on.  We can infer
that this does not produce a self-sustaining chain reaction because
natural lithium still contains 92.5% lithium-7, and there is
apparently no critical mass of lithium which results in a uranium-like
or plutonium-like chain reaction.

Lithium, however, is more appealing than thorium for a variety of
reasons, occurs at [17 ppm in the crust, compared to thorium’s 6
ppm][1], and there is an existing industry extracting over half a
million tonnes of it from the crust per year, while thorium only has a
few uses and is somewhat dangerous to refine because of its natural
radioactivity.  Thorium is [imported into the US at a few tens of
tonnes per year, and costs around US$100 per kilogram][2], while
lithium [is imported at a rate of some 3000 tonnes per year and costs
around US$6000 per tonne][3], or US$6 per kilogram.

(Lithium-6 also produces tritium when irradiated with a neutron,
yielding 4.8 MeV.)

The tritium produced also decays energetically with a half-life of
some 12 years; while this is too slow to be useful for a nuclear
weapon, it could be useful for a nuclear reactor.
