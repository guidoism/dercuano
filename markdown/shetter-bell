A better shell might have some or all of the following properties:

- Opens a new pty for each command and allows you to either include
  the whole command output or a scrollable window on it in the overall
  scroll.  Clearing the screen should, by default, fullscreen the
  command output.
- Displays which commands failed and which relied on now-changed
  inputs.  (This requires tracking the inputs of every command.)
- Optionally re-executes selected commands periodically
- Displays per-command resource usage, such as CPU time and RAM usage.
  By default runs commands with limits to prevent horking the whole
  machine.
- Provides notifications of finished, idle, and newly non-idle
  commands in a way that doesn’t interfere with foreground tasks.
  This requires at least some minimum UI for configuring it.
- Copes with voluminous command output gracefully, at least up to
  gigabytes.  Should have options to FIFO-discard, block (like ^S),
  and increase the scrollback-retention limit.
- Supports distributed operation, including running commands on remote
  hosts, inside of Docker containers, and across multiple remote
  hosts, as well as session recovery from network disconnection and
  even machine restart.
- Options for fancifying command output; for example, hyperlinking
  `ls` and `ps` output, or colorizing and relayouting other commands’
  output.
- Programmable autocomplete, of course.
