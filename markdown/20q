Summary: 20q.net seems to do badly at choosing questions.  It was able
to guess the axolotl and the domestic cat; but it missed the sailboat,
a gallon bottle of milk, one million, basil, a knife-sharpening stone,
methyl ethyl ketone, Che Guevara's corpse, Mare Imbrium, and a leather
high-heeled tango shoe.

Well, it's hardly surprising that it had so much trouble guessing in
that case.  I had two "wrong" answers.

Still, it doesn't seem like 20Q is doing the best possible job of
choosing questions.  How often is an animal an appliance, and how
often does an animal that doesn't live in salt-water live in the
ocean?

I'm pretty sure that it can only live out of water if given an iodine
injection to induce metamorphosis.

I don't know what kind of people think that basil doesn't smell sweet
and isn't used in Oriental cooking.
