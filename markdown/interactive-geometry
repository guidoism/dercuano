To make an interactive geometry application, maybe when a point or
line or arc or whatever is selected, then the things you can construct
from there should be immediately visible and selectable, with a little
pushbutton to create each one.  Maybe things like midpoints and
intersections should be created as soon as segments and lines are, as
in Laszlo Pandy’s (and Bret Victor’s?) dynamic drawing application.

To clean up clutter, you might want to have some constructions that
are a little more at arm’s length; given a library of them, you could
choose one to instantiate a cartoon of it with a little pushbutton on
each of its inputs.  Then you can constrain it to objects in your
scene one by one.

Additionally, you may want to put some things in another layer, then
hide that layer.  In multitouch, this can be done with a layer
quasimode.
