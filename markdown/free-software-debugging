Chapter 2 of Andreas Zeller's book "Why Programs Fail" describes the
following life cycle for a software problem that involves a bug fix:

> 1. The user informs the vendor about the problem.
> 2. The vendor reproduces the problem.
> 3. The vendor isolates the problem circumstances.
> 4. The vendor locates and fixes the defect locally.
> 5. The vendor delivers the fix to the user.
> 6. [implicitly] The vendor delivers the fix to other users.

One of the advantages of free software is that it often allows the
following lifecycle instead:

> 1. The user reproduces the problem.
> 2. The user isolates the problem circumstances.
> 3. The user locates and fixes the defect locally.
> 4. The user publishes the fix so that other users can use it.
> 5. The user informs the maintainer about the problem.
> 6. The maintainer delivers the fix to other users.

When the problem is sufficiently important to the user, this is much
preferable to the traditional cycle described above; the time from
step #1 to step #3 can often be minutes or hours instead of weeks,
months, or years --- and many problems never get fixed, either because
they're put in place deliberately by vendors, or because they're not
important to the vendor.

In addition to giving the user their bug fix more quickly, it also
often reduces the total amount of work involved.  Zeller's steps #1
and #2 often involve a lot of communication back and forth between the
vendor and the user, as the user tries to supply enough information
for the vendor to reproduce the problem, perhaps weeks or months after
the fact, but without including any confidential information.  An
omitted step (in both sequences) is prioritization of the problem,
which is dependent (in Zeller's sequence) on the information provided
by the user; if it appears to be a problem that doesn't affect many
people, the vendor is likely not to bother to reproduce and isolate it
quickly.
