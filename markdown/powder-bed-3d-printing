I just wrote this long thing in `glass-fluxing-3d-printing` about a
powder-bed 3-D printing technique that deposits a binder that’s
completely inert at room temperature, but upon firing the print in a
kiln, becomes active.

I think there are a variety of other possibilities in powder-bed 3-D
printing that have not yet been fully explored.

Magnesium oxychloride Sorel cement
----------------------------------

[Sorel cement][0] is a combination of highly water-soluble [magnesium
chloride][1] (nigari) with highly water-insoluble [magnesium oxide][2]
(milk of magnesia); it’s a cement similar to Portland cement, but more
refractory, less water-resistant (and won’t harden underwater), and
nearly twice as strong.

So, although I’d have to investigate more, I think you could use an
aqueous solution of magnesium chloride to moisten a powder bed of sand
and dry magnesium oxide to form a very strong mortar.

Selective hammering
-------------------

Instead of squirting binders onto a powder bed like an inkjet printer,
you could bang the shit out of it with hammers like a dot-matrix
printer, ideally under vacuum so that you don’t generate explosive gas
expulsions.  The impact will stick together the particles in the
vicinity, affecting a total mass of powder material similar to the
total mass of the hammer.  (This suggests that low-mass hammers are in
some sense optimal.)

Selective electrical sintering
------------------------------

For beds of metal particles, instead of squirting binders, you could
touch the surface of the powder with an electrode and drive a large
current into it, sintering the nearby particles together through joule
heating of their contact points, like an old-fashioned [coherer][3].

The electrode would probably have to be a carbon rod, since any other
plausible material is likely to stop working due to surface oxidation.

This probably won’t produce a strongly bonded part, but might be
enough to produce a solid part that can then be solidified further by
other means.

Calcium cross-linking
---------------------

A number of anions, such as carbonate and alginate, form water-soluble
compounds with monovalent cations like those of the alkali metals
(sodium, potassium) while forming water-insoluble compounds with
divalent cations like those of the alkaline earth metals (calcium,
magnesium).  Calcium and magnesium also have highly water-soluble
salts, such as their nontoxic chlorides.

This means that by mixing two liquids you can precipitate a solid
through a [double ion replacement reaction][4].  This is used in
[molecular gastronomy spherification][5] of foods, forming a flexible
calcium alginate membrane around a liquid center with sodium alginate
dissolved in it.

(I’m pretty sure this is because these anions are polyvalent and are
strongly enough bonded to their cations that they are solvated
together with them, rather than separately, so that once the cations
are also polyvalent, the individual anions floating around with their
individual cation harems are replaced by endless chains in which each
cation links together different anions.  But I’m no chemist.)

Other polyvalent cations should also work for this.

So the plan is that you precipitate a solid cement in the interstices
of an aggregate or filler.

Bicarbonate as a hydroxyl donor
-------------------------------

Cyanoacrylates polymerize in the presence of hydroxyl ions; dripping
cyanoacrylate onto NaHCO₃, stealing hydroxyl ions and converting it to
sodium carbonate, is a well-known manual additive manufacturing
technique which can probably be improved by adding filler to the
NaHCO₃.

Bicarbonate as a CO₂ donor
--------------------------

Waterglass forms a silica gel rapidly upon exposure to CO₂; maybe you
can use NaHCO₃ as a CO₂ donor for this purpose.  Certainly you can
harden it with acids instead.
