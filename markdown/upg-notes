Maybe we're doing something wrong, because I can't find anybody
writing on the web having trouble with git and umask, although it
looks like the umask situation in Debian has been kind of a PITA for a
while.

The Current State of the umask Problem
--------------------------------------

So I made the mistake of believing /etc/skel/.profile when it
said:

    # the default umask is set in /etc/profile

It turns out /etc/profile doesn't do squat when you do this:

$ ssh watchdog.notabug.com umask

because there's no login shell involved.  It does read .bashrc, but
having every subshell reset your umask would be annoying and maybe
dangerous.

/etc/login.defs explains:

    # UMASK usage [in /etc/login.defs] is discouraged because it
    # catches only some classes of user entries to system, in fact
    # only those made through login(1), while setting umask in shell
    # rc file will catch also logins through su, cron, ssh etc.
    #
    # At the same time, using shell rc to set umask won't catch
    # entries which use non-shell executables in place of login shell,
    # like /usr/sbin/pppd for "ppp" user and alike.
    #
    # Therefore the use of pam_umask is recommended (Debian package
    # libpam-umask) as the solution which catches all these cases on
    # PAM-enabled systems.
    #
    # This avoids the confusion created by having the umask set in two
    # different places -- in login.defs and shell rc files (i.e.
    # /etc/profile).
    #
    # For discussion, see #314539 and #248150 as well as the thread
    # starting at
    # http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01598.html

But for whatever reason, libpam-umask is not installed and used by
default.

Consequently there are now a bunch of directories in
/home/watchdog/code/.git that are writable only by "aaronsw", so I
probably won't be able to push any more changes until we fix that.

Why This Problem Arose
----------------------

Probably everybody knows, but just for the record.

Debian by default uses "UPG" or "User Per Group".  This lets you leave
your umask at 002 (or 007, or 000) all the time, and just use group
ownership to distinguish private from shared files; private files
belong to the group that contains only you.

But not all people, or all software, have adapted to this new world,
so sometimes people like to have other umasks.  This causes the
problem we're seeing here: accidentally creating directories other
people can't write to in shared spaces.

Why We Should Care
------------------

If we can get the infrastructure into a smoothly working state, we
don't have to struggle with it later on.  The opportunity cost of time
at the start of a project is high, so it's hard to justify spending
time on stuff like this up front, but the psychological phenomenon of
hyperbolic discounting exaggerates that opportunity cost.  I think
putting in an hour or so on this stuff now will save us two or three
hours over the course of the next few weeks.

Probably all of us have been burned a few times by not keeping our
infrastructure in adequate order, so I expect this should be an easy
sell.

What We Should Do
-----------------

First, aaronsw or root should fix the nonwritable directories:

$ chmod g+w $(find /home/watchdog/code/.git -perm -200 ! -perm -020 -print)

Then we should fix the umask. Two choices:

1. use libpam-umask.  I've tested this on my server and it works:

    kragen@courageous:~$ sudo apt-get install libpam-umask

    Put this line at the end of /etc/pam.d/common-session:
    session    optional     pam_umask.so umask=002

    Remove the "umask 002" line from /etc/profile.

2. Put 'if [ "$SHLVL" = 1 ] ; then umask 002; fi' into
   /etc/bash.bashrc.  Putting this in .bashrc does seem to work (I'm
   testing it on another server where other people didn't like the
   libpam-umask approach), so putting it in /etc/bash.bashrc should
   work too, as long as everyone uses bash.
