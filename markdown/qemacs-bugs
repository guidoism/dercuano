I downloaded and built QEmacs.  It's a good enough Emacs I could almost use it!
Which is inspiring, since it was an individual spare-time project by one
person, even if that one person is Fabrice Bellard.  So I thought I'd take some
notes on its deficiencies to see if it's fixable, or how much more work would
be needed to make something really usable.

- Crashes sometimes in help.  Open qe_g, C-h b q
- open a C file and type

    typedef struct node {

    and QEmacs takes you to the beginning of the line. Follow that up with
    `enum {` and it happens again.

    Type `typedef int buf[4];` and it happens again. I think this is just
    part of a general problem it has with indenting C.

- Yes, it can open a text file of nearly 300 megabytes. But going to the end
  of the file is slow.

- Doesn't support M-^, M-;.

- C-x C-e (compile) tries to execute the make command in the directory where
  qemacs started, not where the file is.

- repeated C-k doesn't append to the latest kill-ring item as it should, so
  you can't use it to cut blocks of text.

- M-q takes you out of your paragraph, so you can't just keep typing.

- Redisplay is visibly slow and not double-buffered.

- Doesn't support ~ in filenames.

- Doesn't support M-/

- Control-backspace is "help" instead of "backward-kill-word".

- When there's pending keyboard input, it wastes time updating the screen
  with already-stale state!

- Undo works in individual buffer changes, rather than commands, which is
  quite suboptimal with M-q and also with undoing typing.

- Doesn't support prefix arguments. M-5 M-6 M-g prompts you for a line
  number.

- M-y (yank-pop) causes subsequent C-y to yank the same thing. Maybe this is
  an improvement.

Still, it's impressive how much like Emacs it can feel with only 88 commands!
