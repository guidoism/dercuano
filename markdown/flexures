Flexures are a different way to design machinery, a little-understood
one.  They have many surprising advantages and disadvantages compared
to traditional machinery, the kind made of rigid bodies that interact
by intermittent and often sliding contact, plus the occasional
discrete spring.  At present, they are mostly used for bearings and
“living hinges”, but they are capable of much more.

Disadvantages of flexures include:

- Typically, movements are very small relative to the size of the
  machine or device, because most materials have a relatively small
  elongation at break;
- Continuous rotary motion is impossible and you must settle for
  reciprocating motion;
- Routing “signals” is difficult in a way that it is not in
  traditional machinery, as (at least in flexures cut from a sheet)
  crossing two “signals” over one another is tricky, as if you were
  laying out a one-sided printed-circuit board;
- very limited design tradition; the 2008 edition of the Machinery’s
  Handbook contains 3740 pages of information on designing traditional
  machinery, but not a single mention of flexure design, other than
  springs.

The advantages of flexures, however, are astonishing:

- Because there is no sliding contact, there is no wear.  There may be
  fatigue, but just as with traditional springs, it is possible to
  keep fatigue at bay for impressively long times.
- There is no backlash, and thus no tradeoffs between backlash and
  binding.
- Flexures do not need to be lubricated, because they have no sliding
  contact.
- There is no static friction; although flexures can be designed to
  lock in positions of local energy minima, they don’t develop them
  spontaneously every time they stop moving, the way sliding contact
  does.
- Very high precision is achievable because of the lack of wear,
  backlash, and static friction; scanning tunneling microscopes, for
  example, maneuver their probe tips with a repeatability in the range
  of 10 picometers.
- In the appropriate materials, dynamic friction can be made
  arbitrarily low, although this involves tradeoffs against speed, and
  consequently efficiency can be made arbitrarily high.
- Because of the lack of wear, backlash, and static friction, as well
  as the resulting high precision, flexures are increasingly favorable
  at small sizes.
- Flexures can tolerate fairly contaminated environments without
  losing precision.
- Flexures that can be fabricated by cutting a sheet or plate can be
  manufactured at extremely low cost, even without mass production.
  Here in Buenos Aires, laser-cutting shops will cut 3mm MDF to a
  precision of about 100μm at a cost of about US$50/hour and a cutting
  speed of about 30mm/s, which is to say about 300 “pixels” per
  second; this gives you about 20 kilopixels per dollar.  Plasma-cut
  sheet steel is about twice as expensive, but about an order of
  magnitude better performance by most measures.
- Flexures in hard materials can effectively use piezoelectric
  actuators, which can act at frequencies up into the megahertz.  By
  contrast, air bearings are limited to frequencies of around 150krpm
  (16 kHz), two or three orders of magnitude lower, and non-air-
  bearing sliding-contact machinery is typically limited to no more
  than 10krpm (1kHz).  So flexure machinery can exceed the speed of
  sliding-contact machinery by two to five orders of magnitude.
- Flexures have no trouble operating in conditions that are very
  hostile to lubricants, including hard vacuum, cryogenic cold (with
  appropriate flexure material), and extreme heat (again, with
  appropriate material).

In the early 1990s, as a rebuttal to concerns that molecular
nanotechnology would not provide practical advantages in computation
because of high energy consumption, Ralph Merkle outlined the design
of a flexure-based reversible computer using “buckling-spring logic”,
so flexures are capable of very complex tasks.  Given their
reliability and speed advantages over sliding-contact machinery,
flexures are likely to shine in mechanical computing and automated
fabrication applications.

Stuart Smith’s 2000 book on flexures defines them as “a mechanism
consisting of a series of rigid bodies connected by compliant elements
that is designed to produce a geometrically well-defined motion upon
application of a force.”  He cites the following as their advantages
and disadvantages:

> ### Advantages of flexures ###
>
> 1. They are simple and inexpensive to manufacture and assemble.
>
> 2. Unless fatigue cracks develop, the flexures undergo no
>    irreversible deformations and are, therefore, wear-free.
>
> 3. Complete mechanisms can be produced from a single monolith.
>
> 4. Mechanical leverage is easily implemented.
>
> 5. Displacements are smooth and continuous.  Even for applications
>    requiring displacements of atomic resolution, flexures have been
>    shown to readily produce predictable and repeatable motions at
>    this level.
>
> 6. Failure mechanisms such as fatigue and yield are well understood.
>
> 7. They can be designed to be insensitive to thermal variations and
>    mechanical disturbances (vibrations).  Symmetric designs can be
>    inherently compensated and balanced.
>
> 8. There will be a linear relationship between applied force and
>    displacement for small distortions.  For elastic distortions,
>    this linear relationship is independent of manufacturing
>    tolerance.  However, the direction of motion will be less well
>    defined as these tolerances are relaxed.
>
> ### Disadvantages of flexures ###
>
> 1. Accurate prediction of force-displacement characteristics
>    requires accurate knowledge of the elastic modulus and
>    geometry/dimensions.  Even tight manufacturing tolerances can
>    produce relatively large uncertainty between predicted and actual
>    performance.

> 2. At significant stresses there will be some hysteresis in the
>    stress-strain characteristics of most materials.
>
> 3. Flexures are restricted in the length of translation for a given
>    size and stiffness.
>
> 4. Out of plane stiffness values are relatively low and drive
>    direction stiffness tends to be relatively high in comparison to
>    other bearing systems.
>
> 5. They cannot tolerate large loads.
>
> 6. Accidental overload can be catastrophic or, at least,
>    significantly reduce fatigue life.
>
> 7. At large loads there may be more than one state corresponding to
>    equilibrium, possibly leading to instabilities such as buckling
>    or ‘tin-canning’.
