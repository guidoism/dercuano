An “airfryer” is a sort of convection oven that rapidly achieves
frying-like results by blowing hot air over the food at very high
speed, browning the surface.  It occurred to me that you could,
similarly, use high-speed pumped water circulation to rapidly heat
food to boiling, or with some pressure, a bit higher than boiling.
You can't brown the surface but you can cook the food.

This may be less of a difference from regular cooking (than an
airfryer) because the bubbles rising in a boiling pot already produce
substantial water circulation, far more than the air convection in a
conventional oven; also, the water’s thermal conductivity and specific
heat are much higher and close to the food’s, so perhaps in a boiling
pot heat is already being transferred to the food so rapidly that most
of the thermal resistance is in the food, not the heat transfer
medium.
