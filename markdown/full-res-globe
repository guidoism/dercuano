Suppose you want to make a globe with outrageously high resolution.
Maybe you want to map every street in the world, or every car.  How
much space do you need?

The Earth is almost exactly 40 000 000 meters around (the small error
in this number is due to long-ago measurement mistakes), and to see
every street, you need no worse than, say, 15-meter resolution — which
you can get from, say, Landsat.  OpenStreetMap may be a more
interesting data source.

40 million divided by 15 gives you 2⅔ million pixels around your
globe.  If you're using a regular 600dpi laser printer, your globe is
370 feet in circumference, or 18 meters in radius, 36 in diameter.
Your globe will be about 14 stories tall.

To reduce that to a single story tall, you'd need to reduce the size
by 16×, to 9600dpi.  At this resolution, your pixels are only 2.6
microns wide: within the range of what you can see with a light
microscope, but not easily.

However, 9600dpi is somewhat difficult to achieve.  2400dpi is
supposedly achievable on high-end inkjet printers, and you might be
able to use photographic reduction processes to reduce them 4:1.
