Watching [TinselKoala’s (TKLabs’s) transmission-line model
demonstration][0], which uses an analog delay line made of inductors
and capacitors to set up a standing wave that varies by frequency,
with LEDs connected to show where the antinodes were, it occurred to
me that perhaps you could use this approach for analog detection of
voice frequency spectrum.

He’s using the interference patterns of the reflection in the
unterminated analog delay line to get different patterns of lights on
the LEDs.  This is purely a linear phenomenon, so the pattern of
standing voltages that will show up for signals at different
frequencies is the sum of the voltages for the individual signals.

I think that you can get signals to bounce back and forth in the
transmission line many times by using a large resistor on the input.
Only harmonic frequencies will produce recognizable patterns of nodes
and antinodes, I think?  I don’t know how well this will work to
separate harmonic frequencies from inharmonic ones.

Anyway, can you use these standing-wave shapes to detect a set of
frequency buckets spread across several octaves?  I think so.  And you
don’t need, necessarily, a compact analog delay line made of
capacitors and inductors.  You may be able to use AM modulation to
upconvert a waveform from audio frequencies up to frequencies high
enough that you can fit them into a short piece of coax, although
perhaps they won’t be resonant frequencies.
