[The ESP8266 uses 200 mA at 3.3V when operating][0], which is 660 mW.
With a duty cycle of 4.5%, that’s 30 mW; in sleep mode it takes a bit
under 3 mW.  [People report success in getting it to average
18 mW][4].  It costs about US$6.  [Brian Benchoff reports a range of
366 m][2] with the antenna that’s built into the printed circuit
board.  The [IXYS SLMD121H04L solar cell][1] costs US$6.20 in quantity
1 and yields 89 mW in, presumably, full sun; it’s 43 mm x 14 mm
(150 μW/mm²).  So you could run an ESP8266 off it during the daytime
with a fairly reasonable duty cycle, given reasonable power circuits.
A [10000 μF 35V TDK aluminum electrolytic capacitor][3] costs US$2.60
and is 22 mm diameter × 52 mm long; it can store, in theory, 6 joules,
which is 9 seconds of full-duty-cycle operation.

You could set up a mesh network of solar-powered ESP8266s 250 m apart
in order to provide a communication line.  You could drop them in
trees, on top of smokestacks, on the roofs of industrial buildings,
painted black.  Each board might cost US$25, so you would need to
spend US$100 per kilometer.
