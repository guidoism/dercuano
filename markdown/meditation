From _The Mind Illuminated_, p. 117:

> Meditation is a series of simple tasks, easy to perform, that only
> need to be repeated until they bear fruit.  So where is the sense of
> difficulty and exertion coming from?  We usually describe a task as
> difficult because we’re dissatisfied with our performance, which
> means we’ve started judging.  Your expectations haven’t been met,
> and maybe you’re starting to doubt whether you’ll ever succeed,
> which can sap your motivation.  You’re not actually struggling with
> meditating, you’re struggling with unrealistic expectations and an
> idealized image of what you think “should” be happening.  As a
> result, it feels like you’re forcing yourself to do something you
> think you aren’t very good at.  If you believe those feelings, the
> ego-Self naturally wants to avoid blame. If you can convince
> yourself that you’ve been trying really hard, then the ego-Self
> doesn’t feel guilty for not meeting its own self-imposed
> expectations.  You can blame the teacher, the method, or concoct a
> story about how meditation isn’t right for you. The real issue isn’t
> that meditation takes too much effort, or that something is innately
> wrong with you, it’s your judgment and expectations.

Useful to keep in mind.
