What’s the maximum energy density of a spring?  What material is best?

As you put more and more energy into a spring, eventually you will
break it.  The properties of the spring material put a limit on how
much energy you can store in the material before you break it.

Typically the relevant numbers are yield stress (or elastic limit) and
some kind of modulus of stiffness.  Some springs are stressed in shear
(like a torsion bar in torsion, or a coil spring in compression or
tension), while others are stressed in tension or compression, like
the surfaces of a leaf spring or a bow.

Common geometries, like the torsion bar, coil spring, or leaf spring,
have a zero-stress region in the middle of the material, with stress
increasing linearly up to the surface, where it is at a maximum.  This
geometry reduces the spring’s energy density to half of the
theoretical maximum for the material.  Other geometries, such as
tubular torsion bars or I-beam leaf springs, can reduce the wasted
weight.  Springs stressed in pure compression, like a squeezed block
of rubber, or in pure tension, like a stretched wire, do not have this
problem.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_modulus> say:

> The shear modulus is one of several quantities for measuring the
> stiffness of materials. All of them arise in the generalized Hooke's
> law:
> 
> * Young's modulus describes the material's response to uniaxial
>   stress (like pulling on the ends of a wire or putting a weight on
>   top of a column),
> * the bulk modulus describes the material's response to uniform
>   pressure (like the pressure at the bottom of the ocean or a deep
>   swimming pool)
> * the shear modulus describes the material's response to shear
>   stress (like cutting it with dull scissors).

It also gives a table:

has 13 values for the shear modulus that are totally useless because
they have no attribution and no units.  (Also, they have no
precision.)

The number I was looking for is called the “specific energy” or
“elastic potential energy per unit volume”.
