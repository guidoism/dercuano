[An overview of USB][0] says low-speed data is “clocked at 1.50Mb/s
with a data signalling tolerance of ±1.5% or 15,000ppm” so you can
clock it with a [ceramic] resonator instead of needing a crystal.

AVRs’ internal RC resonators are mostly not quite this precise; even
at a fixed temperature and voltage and after user calibration, they’re
rated to vary by 2%, at least on the ATtiny2313.  But on the ATMega
series (at least the 48/88/168/328 series used in the Arduino),
they’re rated to ±1% under these circumstances.  So a resonator is
needed to bitbang low-speed USB on the ATtinies, but maybe not the
ATMegas.
