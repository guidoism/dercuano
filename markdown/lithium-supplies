Terrestrial lithium supplies provide adequate energy storage to reach Kardashev Type 1
======================================================================================

While the amount of solar energy available is far greater than world
marketed energy consumption, by about four orders of magnitude, solar
energy mostly only arrives during the day, and sometimes even during
the day most of it is blocked by clouds, while existing marketed
energy is generally available 24 hours per day.  The impending
transition to a photovoltaic-solar-energy-based economy therefore has
many of the humans worried about the “intermittency problem” or the
“storage problem”.

Intermittent usage, or demand response
--------------------------------------

Probably the most important result of the intermittency problem is
that the humans will use energy intermittently.

In some cases this is relatively straightforward and already
practiced — for example, it’s common for large air-conditioning
systems on commercial properties to run their chillers during the
night, when electrical energy is cheap, to store up ice, and then use
the melting ice during the day to chill a coolant which is circulated
to chill air, and electric car owners often have a lot of latitude
about when they charge up.

In other cases, it’s a matter of moving demand
geographically — perhaps a Google Search query needs to be done in a
data center close to the requester, but a large finite-element
simulation can be done in whichever data center the computation is
cheapest.  And in some cases long-distance power transmission can
bridge a storm cloud.

In other cases, idling machinery at night is expensive because of the
mere depreciation of the machinery, and it might be worth paying
higher energy costs.

In still other cases, like life-support machinery and alarm systems,
it’s worth paying even extremely high energy costs to guarantee
uninterrupted power.

Lithium battery storage
-----------------------

Right now, the popular approach to utility-scale energy storage to
reduce solar intermittency is lithium-ion batteries, similar to the
Tesla PowerWall or Jehu Garcia’s DIY powerwall projects, but larger.
(There are a dozen other possibilities — the Sisyphean train,
[pumped-water storage][0], flywheels, compressed-air caverns, vanadium
flow batteries, hydrogen or methane fuel cells, molten-metal
batteries, and so on — but lithium is the currently popular one.)  You
might reasonably wonder: is there enough lithium?

### The Earth’s crust contains about 10¹⁷ kg of lithium ###

(Updated from my [comments on the orange website][1].)

In 2018, the USGS estimated [16 million tonnes of “worldwide
identified reserves” of lithium][2] (1.6 × 10¹⁰ kg), but about 53
million tonnes of “resources” of lithium (5.3 × 10¹⁰ kg), which are
extractable with current techniques but not necessarily economic at
current prices.  There’s also 2.3 × 10¹⁴ kg of lithium [dissolved in
seawater][3], and the estimates of lithium abundance in the earth’s
crust have a low end of 20 ppm. The crust averages about 40 km thick
and 3 g/cc in the 29% of the Earth that has continents, which works
out to 1.5 × 10¹⁴ m², 5.9 × 10¹⁸ m³, 1.8 × 10²² kg of rock, and 3.6 ×
10¹⁷ kg of lithium.

World lithium “production” (which is to say, extraction) is about 4.3
× 10⁷ kg per year, which would take 350 years to exhaust the
“worldwide identified reserves”. It seems like a safe bet that some
new mining technologies will become available before even 2100, let
alone 2369.

Lithium is not destroyed when it is used — you can recycle worn-out
batteries into new batteries — so, like gold, we should expect that
eventually the amount circulating is much greater than the amount
mined in any given year or decade.  But, how much would need to be
circulating for the humans to start using lithium batteries to power
entire continents overnight?  Maybe extraction would have to speed up?

### The lithium in the crust can store 130 zettajoules ###

[Wikipedia’s table of energy densities][4] says Li-ion batteries
contain 0.36–0.88 MJ/kg, or slightly higher if you only count the mass
of the lithium rather than the entire battery.  Conservatively taking
0.36 MJ per kg of lithium (which assumes battery technology doesn't
improve — almost-nonrechargeable lithium-metal batteries get five
times that much energy per kg of lithium), the 1.6 × 10¹⁰ kg of
“identified reserves” would hold 5.8 petajoules; the 2.3 × 10¹⁴ kg of
lithium in seawater would hold 83 exajoules; and the 3.6 × 10¹⁷ kg
of lithium in the continental crust would hold 130 zettajoules.

[4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Table_of_energy_content

[Current world marketed energy consumption][5] is on the order of 5.7
× 10²⁰ joules per year, which is 18 terawatts.  Incident solar power
on the Earth (the Kardashev Type 1 benchmark) is 130 petawatts. So the
5.8 PJ of “identified reserves” is only five minutes
of world marketed energy consumption, but the 83 EJ of seawater
lithium is about 1.7 months of world marketed energy consumption. Even
so, that's only 10 minutes of total terrestrial insolation. But the
130 zettajoules of continental crustal lithium is 12 days’ worth of
total terrestrial insolation.

[5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption

So it seems likely that known concentrated lithium deposits will not
be sufficient to permit the transition to solar over the next decade
or two, but there is plenty of lithium in seawater and other,
less-concentrated deposits to permit such a transition.  New
extraction technologies will be needed if lithium batteries are to
bridge the intermittency gap.  Alternatively, some of the other
utility-scale storage technologies might be developed.
