If you want a solar oven, or an electric oven powered by photovoltaic
panels, to work at night, you need an energy store.  The best approach
is probably a phase-change heat reservoir, perhaps with a phase-change
temperature somewhere around 200° or 250°.  Heat can be moved in and
out of the heat reservoir with fan-forced convection.
