Alan Kay, whose team invented object-oriented programming and the
modern graphical user interface, famously said, "The best way to
predict the future is to invent it."  If that's true, then the people
who *control* the future are the ones who are inventing it.  So let's
invent a future we want to live in!

Who are the people and projects inventing a future worth living in
today?

- Yochai Benkler, inventing the economics of the post-scarcity world.
- Michel Bauwens, also, with his Peer-To-Peer Foundation.
- Marcin Jakubowski, and his Factor e Farm/Open Source Ecology/Global
  Village Construction Set project.  See
  <http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Marcin_Log> for what he's doing
  today.
- Nick Mathewson and the rest of the Tor project, trying to enable
  anonymous speech in the age of the internet.
- Kickstarter.
- Wikipedia, which has organized the world's knowledge and made it
  universally accessible and useful, completing the project of
  Diderot's Encyclop√©die a few hundred years late.  Jimmy Wales is its
  most visible spokesperson, but the vast majority of work is being
  done by thousands, if not tens of thousands, of volunteers.
- The Internet Archive.
