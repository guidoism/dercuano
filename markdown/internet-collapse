Occasionally I run into articles about how the internet is doomed for
economic reasons, even today, like [this article by John Michael
Greer][0].  But they’re wrong.  Greer’s basic argument is that
internet services like Facebook are being heavily and unsustainably
subsidized by money-losing venture capitalists and that the internet
as a whole is heavily and unsustainably subsidized by fossil fuels.

Consumer monthly internet service pays the majority of internet costs

It actually is a reasonable measure, because the majority of the cost
of operating the internet as a whole is the cost of operating the
so-called “last mile” service.  The total cost is maybe twice that.

I do, all the time.  They pay substantially less for their bandwidth
and their computers than residential internet users do.  This should
be unsurprising, because they are able to drive bargains with
equipment and bandwidth providers that residential users can’t, and
they can place their computers right next to the internet backbone
instead of stringing cables through urban neighborhoods.

[Twitter’s current operating expenses][1] are around two billion
dollars a year, with [302 million active users][2].  That’s six
dollars per user per year, or 50¢ per user per month.  This is very
small compared to the cost of the price of monthly residential
internet service.

[Facebook’s operating expenses][3] are around ten billion dollars a
year, with which they serve [1.44 billion active monthly users][4],
936 million active each day.  Again, that’s about six dollars per user
per year.

[Wikipedia’s operating expenses][5] are only US$58.5 million, but of
course that doesn’t pay the editors, just the server infrastructure.
Because of Wikipedia’s privacy policy, they don’t know how many people
read Wikipedia every day, but [comScore says it’s about half a
million][6].  That means Wikipedia spends about 10¢ per user per year,
or about 1¢ per user per month.

Now, it’s true that getting some money from the users who benefit from
an internet service into the pockets of a company who provides it is a
pretty big problem, and one that Greer correctly points out many
companies are all too happy to put off solving.  But that doesn’t
imply that the total costs per user are high — as we’ve seen above,
Twitter, Facebook, and Wikipedia (three of [Alexa’s top 10][7]) are
spending 50¢, 50¢, and 1¢ per user per month.  Indeed, in all
likelihood, if Twitter and Facebook weren’t desperately struggling to
get more users, their operating expenses would probably be lower.  But
Twitter’s only been able to put off profitability for so long because
their cost per user is so low.

(If we extrapolate these costs down to a small three-person company,
with each person costing US$100k per year and equipment costing a
similar amount, we end up with US$600k / 50¢ ≈ 1.2 million users as
the smallest viable online service these days.)

I often hear nonsense like this from people who are relatively new to
the internet and therefore don’t remember what it was like before
privatization.  Noncommercial “content” has a history on the internet
far deeper than what is suggested here.

What we’re seeing in practice is that, when you lower the cost of
communication sufficiently, commercial “content” like Encarta or
Encyclopedia Britannica or Microsoft Windows has a really hard time
competing with noncommercial “content” like Wikipedia or FreeBSD (the
free software MacOS is built from).  The big websites like YouTube,
Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter are not sources of content; they’re
just ways for people to talk to each other that happen to be more
convenient and efficient, and no more expensive, than running
peer-to-peer software on their own computers.  The companies that
currently “dominate the industry” (if by that we mean Facebook and
Twitter and not Comcast and VSNL) are only able to do so because they
are successfully able to deliver people to each other.

As long as some people can control the software running on their own
computers and get those computers to talk to each other, companies
like Facebook will have to compete with “free”.  (And as one of the
commenters on Greer’s post points out, BitTorrent already accounts for
the majority of internet traffic.)

Non-fossil-fuel energy is abundant

We’ve already shown above that the degree to which internet users are
being subsidized by money-losing investors and venture capitalists is
very small, but the energy subsidy question here is interesting, and
Greer’s position is spectacularly wrong.

It’s true that our fossil fuels accumulated over half a billion years,
but that does not mean that they are half a billion years of
concentrated solar energy; the vast, vast majority of that solar
energy was reflected or re-radiated into space and lost forever, not
stored away in coal and oil to await humanity.

[Current proven coal reserves][8] are 861 billion tonnes, which at [24
GJ/tonne][9] are about 21 zettajoules.  Oil and gas reserves are
somewhat less.  The earth’s radius is 6400 km, and it receives about
1000 W/m² of solar energy, which is about 128 petawatts over its
circular cross-sectional area.

[8]: http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/where-is-coal-found/
[9]: http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml

That means that current proven coal reserves are 45 hours of
concentrated solar energy, not half a billion years, not a billion
years, not a million years, not a thousand years, not a century, not a
year, not even a week.  Every two days, we receive from the sun as
much energy as all of our currently-known coal reserves.

Historically, it has proven difficult to use solar energy — in part
because, as Greer correctly notes, fossil fuels are more concentrated
and therefore hard to compete with in an economic sense, but also
because of our limited materials and fabrication technology, much as
nitrate mined in Chile was a crucial strategic ingredient for
explosives until the Haber process was invented.

But using solar energy is no longer particularly difficult, if we
measure difficulty in dollars — [Juan Cole collated several
stories][10] of recent utility-scale solar energy, among which is the
news that [Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan just inaugurated the
hundred-megawatt Quaid-e-Azam Solar Plant][11] in Punjab province
built “by China’s Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co Ltd (TBEA) [in] a
year…at a cost of $190 million”.  That’s US$1.90 per watt.  [Spain is
already at 70% carbon-free electricity][12], mostly nuclear,
hydroelectric, and wind.

Speaking of nuclear, the amount of energy available in easily fusible
elements in seawater is comparable to the amount available in solar,
if burned over a reasonable period of time; thorium is somewhat
smaller, while uranium is substantially smaller.  Fusion energy,
hot-dry-rock geothermal (aka “enhanced geothermal systems”), and solar
are each individually capable of getting human civilization to
Kardashev Type 1.

An internet is a more energy-efficient way to communicate
