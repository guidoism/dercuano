Salt depresses the freezing point of water.  When you freeze salty
water, the behavior depends on whether you’re at, above, or below the
eutectic point, -21.1° and 27% NaCl.  If less saline than the eutectic
point, first you get ice crystals sucking up heat and growing without
much salt until the remaining brine is at the eutectic point, at which
point it freezes.  If more saline than the eutectic point, instead you
get salt crystals sucking up (much less) heat and growing without much
water until the remaining brine is at the eutectic point, at which
point it freezes.

On the other hand, if you have salty ice and you melt it partway, the
part that melts first will be the eutectic phase, leaving the
remaining phase (either water or salt) more concentrated in the
remaining crystals.  At this point you can mechanically separate the
two with an arbitrarily small energy input.

I was thinking that you could use this behavior somehow to get a
refrigerator, but now I’m not sure you can.  It seems like the
movement of mass into the eutectic phase is kind of unrecoverable by
freezing and melting.  Maybe you could separate them with a pressure
swing or by distillation.
