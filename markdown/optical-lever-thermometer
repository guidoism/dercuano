Was just watching Dan Gelbart’s video on building large structures
with adhesives (<http://youtu.be/EeEhS3zmnDg>), and he talks about the
danger of mounting mirrors on silicone that changes size with
temperature: if the adhesive layer is not of even thickness, its
thermal expansion and contraction (an order of magnitude greater than
that of metal or glass) will rotate the mirror, and the optical lever
effect then can give you a substantial displacement!  Maybe you can
use this to get a thermometer, although liquids like mercury should
have 3× greater coefficient in effect, since you're interested in the
volumetric rather than linear coefficient of expansion there.

[Some page about cleanrooms][0] says that typically silicones have 30
to 300 ppm per kelvin expansion.  So if you have a 1cm-wide mirror on
a 5mm-thick wedge-shaped cushion of silicone, it should expand by half
a micron per kelvin, or about 10 arc seconds per kelvin.  That's half
a millimeter of displacement at a distance of 10 meters.

This effect seems too small to make into a very useful thermometer.
