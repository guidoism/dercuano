In additional to the usual countercurrent configuration for minimal
heat loss and the cocurrent configuration occasionally used, a
recuperator-type heat exchanger may be arranged in a cross-current
configuration for process intensification, where you have alternating
layers of pipes in the X and Y directions.  (A rete mirabile is a much
better way to do high-density heat exchange, but that is a different
topic.)

This cross-current configuration is optimal, however, for a different
purpose: rapid zone melting.  Although I suspect that the speed of
zone melting is limited by crystal growth speeds, maybe you can still
do it faster by doing it in thin pipes (made of a material that
doesn’t dissolve significantly in the material you’re trying to
purify, of course).  You can run hot coolant through only one or two
cross-current pipes above and below the layer of the material being
purified to melt it in a narrow region, while perhaps simultaneously
running cool coolant through other adjacent pipes to intensify the
temperature gradient.

By switching between pipes, it should be possible to rapidly move the
molten zone along the material being purified.
