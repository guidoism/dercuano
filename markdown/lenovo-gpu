[This card is
reputed](https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-Quadro-K1000M.76894.0.html)
to have 192 Kepler-architecture shader cores (plus another 192 that
are locked), and its performance is similar to the GeForce 630M.  It
[runs at 850 MHz and has 2GiB of
RAM](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/quadro-k1000m.c1425), “16
texture mapping units and 16 ROPs”.

Pixel Rate: 3.400 GPixel/s  
Texture Rate: 13.60 GTexel/s  
FP32 (float) performance: 326.4 GFLOPS  
FP64 (double) performance: 13.60 GFLOPS (1:24)  
DirectXL: 12.0 (11_0)  
OpenGL: 4.6  
OpenCL: 1.2  
Vulkan: 1.1.82  
CUDA: 3.0  
Shader Model: 5.1  

326.4 gigaflops sounds like a lot.  The Intel GPU in my
ultrabook (see file `asus-gpu`) is 51.2 gigaflops, and its CPU is
25.6.  So it’s a bit more than 4× the speed of the ultrabook.

[It’s from
2012](https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=Quadro+K1000M&id=1616)
and still sold for US$60 in 2017.

The memory system is 900 MHz DDR3 and 128 bits wide, so it can do 1800
million 128-bit transactions per second, for a total bandwidth of 28.8
gigabytes per second.

The [GeForce 600 series
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_600_series) on Wikipedia
has further details.  The GeForce 630 is listed as “Entry level”.

By contrast, a current NVIDIA Volta card is the US$9000 Nvidia Quadro
GV100, with 14800 gigaflops, plus tensor processing units that do 4×4
FP16 matrix multiply-accumulates.
