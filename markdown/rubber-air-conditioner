Stretching rubber or other hyperelastic material heats it; allowing it
to relax cools it.  If you have a set of concentric rubber tubes you
can twist, with metal rings embedded at intervals in the tubes to keep
them from collapsing, then the torsion should manifest as heat which
could be carried away by a fluid passed through them; allowing the
torsion to relax should cool the tubes, which can be used to cool a
fluid passed through them at that time.

This allows the construction of a refrigerator whose refrigerant is
solid and thus very safe.  By passing the same air (or other fluid)
through the tubes during successive cooling cycles, it should be
possible to cool it to lower and lower temperatures, until whatever
leakage is inherent in the system cancels it out.

The cooled, stretched rubber has lower tension than the stretched
rubber did when warm, so the relaxation cycle returns less energy to
the motor than was put into it originally, which is where the ability
to reduce the entropy of the air comes from.  Still, it’s likely to be
significant, so it may be desirable to use a flywheel or something in
harmonic motion to recover that energy for the next stretching cycle.

Fatigue is potentially a major problem for this device, since the
rubber needs to last through at least tens of thousands of
stretch-and-release cycles to be useful at all, if not millions; and
the degree to which the rubber can be stretched safely determines the
achievable ΔT.
