How could you architecturally encourage singing in the shower?

Perhaps you could provide carefully tuned resonator cavities that
resonate pleasingly at in-tune frequencies; for example, concrete
pipes of different lengths, sufficiently isolated from the room air as
to have a reasonable *Q*, but sufficiently coupled to it that they can
pick up a note in a reasonable period of time; something like *Q* = 10
or *Q* = 20 should be adequate.

Helmholtz resonators like the ocarina are another, more scalable
possibility, but they only resonate at a single frequency.  Not only
does this deprive you of overtones, it also means you need a separate
set of resonators for each octave.

The presence of such resonators would also enable you to play a tune
on them without singing, just by energizing the resonators, for
example by hitting them with your hands, by hitting them with
Blue-Man-Group floppy paddles, by banging them with hammers, or by
setting firecrackers off in them.

The Pythagorean pentatonic scale
--------------------------------

The simplest musical scale in common use is the Pythagorean pentatonic
scale, consisting of these [intervals][1] from the root note in each
octave:

- 1:1, the diatonic perfect unison, no semitones;
- 9:8, the diatonic minor second, two semitones;
- 4:3, the diatonic perfect fourth, five semitones;
- 3:2, the diatonic perfect fifth, seven semitones; and
- 16:9, the diatonic minor seventh, ten semitones.

I’m not sure exactly how you should combine these Pythagorean
intervals with A440 concert pitch, but one way to do it would be to
ensure that A ends up at 440, but use C as the root note for each
octave.  So to get a C, you take 8/9 of 440 Hz (since C is two
semitones above A) and get 391.1 Hz.  Then you can go down by octaves
from there: 195.6 Hz, 97.8 Hz, 48.89 Hz.  That’s probably deep enough
for singing; so your first octave is 48.89 Hz, 55.00 Hz, 65.19 Hz,
73.33 Hz, 86.91 Hz.

Air-column resonators

Having a node at one end of a tube and an antinode at the other end
means we only need a half-wavelength, which is nice, because the speed
of sound in sea-level, room-temperature air is about 343 m/s, though
it can increase by up to 0.6% with humidity, and decrease considerably
with temperature (`definitions.units` says 331.46 m/s in dry air at
STP).  So a whole wavelength at 48.89 Hz is 7.02 m!  (And that's why a
tuba has so many curls.)

A half-wavelength one-end-open tube at each of these frequencies would
be 3.51 m, 3.12 m, 2.63 m, 2.34 m, and 1.97 m.  But, since those tubes
won’t resonate at an octave, since it isn’t an odd harmonic, you need
five more for the next octave, which is the one people most commonly
talk in: 1.754 m, 1.559 m, 1.315 m, 1.169 m, 0.987 m.  Alternatively,
you could have another set of tubes of the same length, but open at
both ends to raise the pitch by an octave — curved around to open
again into the bathroom, of course.

Speed of sound variation
------------------------

[Wikipedia says][3] the speed of sound in dry air around room
temperature is 331.3 m/s + 0.606 *θ* m/s, where *θ* is the temperature
in °C, or more accurately 331.3 m/s √(1 + *θ*/273.15).
