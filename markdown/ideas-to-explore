- Portals: can I get some kind of usable windowing/hypertext system
  out of circular rotating scaling portals?
- Laser-cut omnitriangulation: can I use tusk tenons to make light,
  airy lattices out of cheap, thin laser-cut MDF?
- Reduced affine arithmetic raytracing: can I make a fast ray tracer
  with it?
- Reduced affine database: can I do a fast query on gobs of
  time-series data with it?
- Circuit simulation: can I get SPICE working in a reasonable way with
  a Falstad-like UI?
- Database exploration: what does it look like to load my mail into
  Kafka/Samza, SQLite, Elasticsearch, LevelDB, Redis, Datomic, or just
  MySQL?
- Home kiln: can I get a reasonably efficient kiln working?
- Programmable logic: can I whip these 2114s and PALCE16V8s into some
  kind of useful logic circuit?
- Fabribot: can I get some kind of fabricating bot working?  Clay
  cutting, 3-D printing, etc.
- Calculator rebraining: can I replace a calculator brain with an AVR
  running my software and get a super-calculator?  (See file
  `rpncalc-thoughts`.)
- Self-sustaining personal computer: can I wedge a Nokia cellphone
  display into a PS/2 keyboard and SD card and get a self-hosting
  computer out of the deal, one that can reprogram itself?
- Moiré servomechanism: can I use moiré patterns between sparse random
  screens with webcams to get high-resolution feedback on where a
  thing is?
- Garbage oscilloscope: can I make a reasonable oscilloscope out of
  common garbage?  (See files `vcr-oscilloscope`, `tv-oscilloscope`,
   `laser-printer-oscilloscope`, and `disk-oscilloscope`.)
- Digraph notation: can I come up with a much better way of describing
  finite state machines, electrical circuit schematics, dataflow
  graphs, and similar graphs?  (See files `graph-construction` and
  `circuit-notation`.)
- Card-based hypertext: what does it look like to re-envision a text
  as a set of linked “cards” small enough that several can be on the
  screen at once, even on a cellphone?  Is this Smallest Federated
  Wiki?
- RPN UI: can I extend rpn-edit to be powerful enough to handle most
  everyday calculations, maybe better than Excel and Python?  (See
  file `rpn-ui`.)
- Synthgramelodia: can I repackage synthgramelodia into a form that
  makes it easy to run and shows what it’s doing?
- Magic Kazoo: can I get a prototype Magic Kazoo running, maybe as an
  Android app?  (See file `magic-kazoo`.)
- Power supply hacking: can I make an adjustable benchtop power supply
  that won’t catch on fire and displays the output voltage with an AVR
  on an LED display?
- Life clock: can I make an LED display of how many days someone
  likely has left to live?
- AVR programmer: can I make a serial programmer to load the Arduino
  bootloader into the various AVR chips I have lying around?  Using
  ArduinoISP, say?
- Tiny bytecode machine: can I implement a tiny bytecode engine that
  allows me to do any further programming in a flexible way?
- Logarithm table memorization: can I practice mental logarithms
  enough to make them a useful calculation shortcut?
- Machine-learning/optimization stuff: what can I do in this area?
  Maybe I need someone else to suggest exercises.  All kinds of
  physical and information design, plus control systems, seem like
  appropriate things to try.
- Tile grid systems: can I make a maze out of user-drawn tiles in
  DHTML?
