The thought that we  
must eliminate single-use disposable goods  
must eliminate plastics  
proceeds not from environmentalism but from Arcadianism  
humans for a hundred thousand generations had to cling to dead things  
good linen, stone houses, stone tools, bone needles, bronze, steel, brass, gold  
cling to a scrap of cloth like a grandmother, for it too cares for you through the winter  
this Arcadian longing for those lost generations is anti-life  
life is not tasteful  
life is not restrained  
life is not frugal  
life is not conservative  
life is not lasting  
those are not virtues for life  
those are virtues for human capital accumulation

life is exuberant  
life is a wild, ever-changing fire upon the surface of the earth  
life is algae blooming in a red tide  
life is ceaseless but never constant  
life is the merciless   
life is the struggle of a thousand salmon that leap frantically past the bears  
before laying five thousand eggs, destroying their viscera with steroids  
life is a sequoia seed awaiting its awakening by fire  
to sprout in the ashes  
life is eager dandelions growing brightly in the cracks of the sidewalk  
life is desperate air plants drilling for moisture in the rain forest bark  
life is a thousand-year-old ginkgo slowly consumed by a fungus in its heartwood  
protecting its delicious nuts with the stench of ten thousand corpses  
life is unstable, exciting, impermanent, and full of death  
life is refulgent purple jacarand√° flowers covering you in brilliant yellow pollen  
life is a peaceful marsh where a crocodile is resting just under the water

when a mushroom is fabricated overnight in the forest  
more intricate than the carvings of any sculptor  
more beautiful than the brushstrokes of any painter  
it is made of a single-use disposable biopolymer  
and is gone inside a week

trees regret not shedding leaves made of single-use disposable biopolymer  
wolves ferociously devour single-use rabbits made of biopolymers and leave disposable droppings

humans had to cling to dead scraps of cloth and care for them like newborn babies  
could not change raiment with the seasons as the snow hare or the goldfinch do  
because a spool of yarn was a day's work

a century ago a tarnished mirror was a sign of wealth  
today they lie discarded in the gutters

those who know the secrets of life and the nature of matter  
can use its own materials for their products  
they are no longer limited to heavy, fragile clay, rusting iron, and dead wood  
but can use the diaphanous resins we call plastics  
to carry water or adorn their children  
they can evaporate aluminum onto glass that floated on tin  
their children can race carbon-fiber bicycles

a cellophane wrapper, a sterile catheter, a condom  
betoken the liberation of the humans from the toil of a hundred thousand generations  
and pitiless disease that killed one out of every five children before adulthood
