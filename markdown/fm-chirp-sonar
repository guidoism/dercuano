Linear FM chirp sonar is cool.

If you emit a sound chirping linearly from 6 kHz to 10 kHz over the
course of two seconds, and it bounces off some object 1.72 meters away
through air, the 10-ms-delayed echo signal will be 20 Hz lower than
the outgoing signal; if the amplitudes are within an order of
magnitude or so, this will result in audible 20 Hz beating between the
outgoing signal and the echo.  If you jump back down to 6 kHz at the
end of the two seconds, you’ll have a 10-ms length of time where the
beating sound disappears, but that’s still a 99.5% duty cycle.

(This is a chirp rate of 2 kHz/s; 343 m/s is 172 m/s in round-trip
meters, so this works out to about 11.66 Hz/m.)

You should probably be able to distinguish by ear a difference of ½ Hz
as long as it’s more than about 10%; this would limit you to 10%
distance resolution at far distances and 43 mm distance resolution at
near distances.  A higher chirp rate would give you tighter distance
resolution, but you would also run out of audible frequencies sooner.

Writing a C program to generate such a chirp took a few minutes, and
in practice I don’t seem to be able to do this by ear.
