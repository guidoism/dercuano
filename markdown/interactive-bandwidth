The internet connection here is broken.  I just used Android tethering
to log in, read my mail, check a couple of chat channels, and answer
some chat messages, for about ten minutes.  At the end, ssh reported:

    Transferred: sent 23048, received 60304 bytes, in 618.1 seconds
    Bytes per second: sent 37.3, received 97.6

That is, on average over those 10 minutes, I was typing and otherwise
sending data at “373 baud” and reading at “976 baud”.  The incoming
number was, I think, reduced by about a factor of 2 by gzip
compression.

This 500-bit-per-second range is interesting, because it’s a fairly
easy bandwidth to achieve under many circumstances.  I think you
should be able to do better than this with subliminal audio coding
layered on top of a voice channel, for example, and even simple binary
FSK coding at audio frequencies can achieve it pretty easily.  It’s
about a factor of 20 less bandwidth than the “2G” GSM GPRS data
connection I often used to read my email in 2001.

At times, today’s connection was hard to use because of unpredictable,
high latency.  But high latency is not inherent to the low-bandwidth
domain — indeed, often you can trade bandwidth off against latency,
for example with data compression or more aggressive error-correction
coding, but also in a more general way by having a wider choice of
acceptable communication media.
