I was writing in file `paper-foil-relays` about macroscopic
electrostatic relays made from paper and graphite.  Metal foil is
another potential material for such devices, which deflect an
insulator bearing conductive contacts using the electrostatic force on
a conductive plate mounted on the insulator.  Metal foil can also be
mirror-reflective, which means that by deflecting it in this way, you
can also redirect light.  Indeed, as described in file
`caustic-business-card`, even submicron deflection of the foil surface
can be sufficient to produce visible reflection effects nearby.  You
could produce such deflections fairly quickly and with fairly low
voltages.
