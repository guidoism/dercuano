As I was adding materials data to file `powder-bed-3d-printing` I
happened across a material I'd never heard of before that seemed like
a better fit for what I was looking for than any of the materials I
*had* heard of: aluminum orthophosphate, the mineral [berlinite].

[berlinite]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlinite

I looked into its synthesis, and what I found was absolutely
astounding; I must be missing something important, because it seems
like a fairly revolutionary new material, but no revolution has
happened yet.

Berlinite is XXX

Grover et al.'s low-temperature synthesis
-----------------------------------------

In 1999 some researchers at Argonne National Lab and Purdue
investigating the problem of safe nuclear waste storage published [a
paper on a berlinite-bonded alumina ceramic][Grover et al.], entitled
"Low-temperature synthesis of berlinite-bonded alumina ceramics".
Their stunning claim was that they had synthesized berlinite *at 150°*
by heating a hydrated aluminum phosphate they made by partly
dissolving alumina in aqueous phosphoric acid at 130°.

[Grover et al.]: https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:33000620 "S. E. Grover, S.Y. Jeong, A. Wagh, and T.R. West  (Aug 1999). (ANL/ET/CP-97994).  11 p; 101. Annual American Ceramic Society Meeting, Symposium on Waste Management Science and Technology in the Ceramic and Nuclear Industries; W-31109-ENG-38. Available from OSTI as DE00011185.  IAEA reference number 33000620, INIS volume 33, issue 1."

In detail, they heated a slurry of alumina (micron-sized mixed with
sand) with 50 wt.% phosphoric acid with an
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> weight ratio
of 5:1, detected an endothermic reaction at 118° with differential
thermal analysis, held it at 130° for 1, 2, or 4 days to allow the
reaction to complete, identified with X-ray diffraction that it
produced an intermediate phase of monoaluminum phosphate
AlH<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O mixed with
the remaining alumina; they described the mixture as "a thick
puttylike...gel", which they left at ambient temperature for another
week "so that some crystalline growth would occur".  They dried the
samples into "hard monoliths", which "disintegrated when placed in
water".

All of the above had been done by previous researchers.  But then they
baked the "monoliths" at 150° for one, two, and three days:
"Significant porosity developed in the monoliths as bound water
escaped through an increasingly viscous slurry."  They infer that the
hot monoaluminum phosphate reacted with *more* of the remaining
alumina to produce berlinite over the course of these days, and
explain, "the resultant ceramic appeared to be a very hard monolith
with dense phases separated by large pores," with some solid
phosphoric acid on top; they measured a compressive strength of 6824
psi (47.05 MPa in modern units) on materials with "20.9 vol.% open
porosity".  This is a bit stronger than ordinary concrete but not
remarkably so, and much lower than high-performance concrete.

Mysteriously, this paper has been almost entirely ignored.  It's been
cited in 2019 by [US patent 10,233,803B2] on exhaust-gas filters with
a catalyst film on a porous ceramic support (and its related 2017
applications in .de, .br, .uk, .cn, .kr, the WIPO PCT ("WO") and the
EPO ("EP")); in 2006 by [US patent 6,858,174B2] on gel-casting ceramic
slurries; by [Stefania CASSIANO GASPAR's dissertation] in 2013 at
INSA-Lyon on extruding porous berlinite-bonded alumina ceramic
supports for catalyst films (in French) for exhaust-gas filtering; by
her 2012 patent ([US 9,227,873B2]) with four other co-authors on the
same subject; and by [a 2015 Russian paper].

Cassiano Gaspar's dissertation also cites some 2010 work by Lee *et
al.* with zeolites in aluminum phosphate, which she reports they got
to be nonporous.

So, why do I think this is such an interesting result?  It gives a
recipe for a moldable porous material that costs about US$3/kg and
produce a result as strong as ordinary concrete, which costs a tenth
of that.  What's so special about that?  After all, if you want
concrete with alumina abrasives in it, you can put some alumina in
your concrete.

Well, a couple of things.  First, this material is, or should be,
highly refractory, despite its low-temperature preparation; I think it
will not spall from heat shocks.  Second, I think it's nontoxic and
noncaustic, unlike portland cement.  It might even be biocompatible,
which conventional phyllosilicate ceramics are not.  XXX
