How do I dynamically generate bytecode?
---------------------------------------

Aside from understanding the JVM bytecode (for which `javap -c` and
[chapter 6][] of the JVM spec are helpful), there’s the question of
how to get from a plan for code to generate to actually being able to
run the code on the JVM, as described in [chapter 5][] of the JVM
spec.

[chapter 6]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html
[chapter 5]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-5.html

At the most basic level, you write a [custom ClassLoader][], which is
five or six lines of code, and invoke `.loadClass(name)` on it.  But
then you still have to generate the bytecode that will define your
class.

(There’s an existing [overview][] of bytecode-generation and
-manipulation libraries for Java at java-source.net.)

That’s what [ObjectWeb ASM][] does; it’s a library for JVM assembly
programming, and it comes with a disassembler, which produces Java
source code that invokes the ObjectWeb ASM APIs.  It’s used by CGLib,
Hibernate, Clojure, Jython, JRuby, and so on.  It may be actively
maintained (it supports Java 8) but change is mostly limited to
bugfixes at this point.  It has a reputation for being simpler to use
than BCEL, because it’s more narrowly focused on generating,
transforming, and analyzing byte arrays representing JVM-bytecode
classes.  Generating a [hello-world class][] with it is 14 lines of
code in the documentation, and [generating a simple method][] as a
sequence of bytecode ops is another six.

[Javassist][] is an actively maintained 16-year-old free-software
library for Java bytecode manipulation, with what seems to be a
better-thought-out and more convenient interface, although it’s hard
to find reasonable documentation (Javadoc doesn’t count!).  It’s
integrated with its own Java compiler, so you can even specify
bytecode to insert in the form of Java source code!  (However, its
Java compiler supports a subset of the full language.)  It’s part of
the JBoss project now, and apparently [uses ObjectWeb ASM][].

[Soot][] is an actively maintained framework for analyzing and
optimizing Java bytecode, supporting different intermediate
representations (each of which has a textual syntax).  It also
supports Android bytecode (which I assume means Dalvik), which makes
it unique among the libraries I’ve looked at.  It’s mostly oriented
toward program analysis (e.g. interprocedural dataflow analysis)
rather than dynamic code generation, but you can also use it for
dynamic code generation; the [hello-world Soot dynamic class][]
requires 28 lines of code to generate. Despite being actively
maintained, it doesn’t yet support Java 8.

[BCEL][], previously known as JavaClass, is a library for generating
and transforming JVM bytecode,.  It comes with, among other things, a
Java disassembler to Jasmin syntax.  It’s at a very similar level to
ObjectWeb ASM, but it looks somewhat more cumbersome to use, although there
are some very cool facilities in it; its most [basic example][],
called HelloWorldBuilder, is over 100 lines, although that includes
things like try-catch blocks.  BCEL seems to have been abandoned in
2006.

[SERP][] is another actively maintained library for, mostly, bytecode
modification, apparently with a stateful DOM-like API.  It’s almost
completely undocumented.

How do I profile?
-----------------

The crudest tool is a thread stack dump, which you can get by typing
control-backslash or by using `jstack` (included with the JVM) with
the appropriate PID.  This will show you the stack of each thread in
your JVM process, from which you can see what it’s currently taking
too long to do.

There’s also a profiler that comes with the JVM called [HPROF][];
you invoke it for CPU-sampling
profiling with `java -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples YourProgram`
or with
entry-and-exit instrumentation, 
which slows the program down by an order of magnitude
but gets accurate call counts,
with `-agentlib:hprof=cpu=times`.

[HPROF]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/samples/hprof.html

[Profiler4j][], open-source, abandoned in 2006, “in beta stage”, based
on bytecode instrumentation.

Some old profilers use the JVMPI interface, which has been [phased out
to be replaced with JVMTI][JVMTI] in current Java.

[JVMTI]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jvmpitransition-138768.html

The Netbeans folks wrote a profiler which is now this separate thing
called VisualVM, which has now expanded far beyond just profiling.
VisualVM is free software but apparently [hasn’t been ported along
with OpenJDK][VisualVM], although there seems to be no licensing
reason not to; maybe you can [compile it from source][], and it
[supports OpenJDK][].

[JIP][] is a profiler that hooks the classloader and uses ObjectWeb ASM to
instrument bytecode as it’s loaded.  It’s supposedly much lower
overhead than hprof.  But it’s been abandoned since like 2008.

[TPTP][] was a profiler integrated into Eclipse, built on JVMTI.  It
was [abandoned in 2011][].

[Jvmtop][] monitors all the JVMs on a machine, like top, and includes
a high-overhead sampling-based CPU console profiler.  Jvmtop as a
whole was abandoned in 2013.

[GCViewer][] is a currently maintained viewer of GC statistics, using
the GC profiling functionality built into the JVM, to help you
understand GC behavior with pretty graphs and extensive statistics.
Jörg Wüthrich took over maintenance from tagtraum industries in 2008.
