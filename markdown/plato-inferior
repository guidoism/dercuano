There is a common misquotation of Plato, which recently came up yet
again on Twitter:

> One of [the] penalties of refusing to participate in politics is you
> end up governed by your inferiors.

Or, worse:

> The price paid by good men for indifference to public affairs is to
> be ruled by evil men.

This is a fake Plato quote.  Plato did say something kind of like
this, but there's a really major difference.

What did Plato really say?
--------------------------

Allan Bloom's precise translation says:

> and the greatest of penalties is being ruled by a worse man if one
> is not willing to rule oneself.

(You could misread this as "if one is not willing to control oneself",
but the Greek text doesn't admit that reading; it clearly means "is
not willing, oneself, to rule.".)

Where are people seeing this fake quote?
----------------------------------------

You can find both versions of this fake quote at misquote-laundering
sites like [Brainyquote][3].

You can also find this quote in misquote-laundering web sites and
publications similarly unconcerned with correctness, such as those by
the Brookings Institution.

Where did the fake quote come from?
-----------------------------------

The real quote in context, from [Benjamin Jowett's loose
translation][0], is as follows:

> Wherefore necessity must be laid upon them, and they must be induced
> to serve from the fear of punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the
> reason why the forwardness to take office, instead of waiting to be
> compelled, has been deemed dishonourable.  **Now the worst part of
> the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled
> by one who is worse than himself**.  And the fear of this, as I
> conceive, induces the good to take office, not because they would,
> but because they cannot help --not under the idea that they are
> going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a
> necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of
> ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.

This is Socrates speaking to Glaucon about three-quarters of the way
through Book I of the Republic, in what's usually known as section
347c.  You will note the very large difference between "refuses to
rule" and "refuses to participate in politics"; anyone who endorses a
candidate, after all, is participating in politics, but only the
leader of the government rules.

The [relevant phrase in the Classic Greek original][1] reads:

> τῆς δὲ ζημίας μεγίστη τὸ ὑπὸ πονηροτέρου ἄρχεσθαι, ἐὰν μὴ αὐτὸς
> ἐθέλῃ ἄρχειν·

WikiQuote, the free world's answer to profiteering falsehood sites
like BrainyQuote, [has several paragraphs of discussion about this
misquotation][4].

At one point I misremembered Plato as saying that this was the penalty
for "not being the tyrant", but that's going too far to the other
extreme, to the extent of inaccuracy.  The Republic talks about
several different forms of government, including absolute power by one
person (the "tyrant", but without the modern derogatory connotation),
and there's no indication that Plato is talking specifically about
seizing absolute power; ἄρχειν just means "to lead", in a very general
sense, but here referring specifically to governing.

But ἄρχειν definitely does *not* mean just "to not be indifferent to
public affairs" or "to participate in politics".

The older version of the falsified quote seems to be this:

> The price paid by good men for indifference to public affairs is to
> be ruled by evil men.

I have a vague memory that this was invented by an American political
group in the mid-20th Century.  The phrase "indifference to public
affairs" seems to have been stolen from Hannah Arendt, in her 1951
_The Origins of Totalitarianism_, near the middle of the book, which
more or less directly contradicts the fake Plato quote:

> Indifference to public affairs, neutrality on political issues, are
> in themselves no sufficient cause for the rise of totalitarian
> movements. The competitive and acquisitive society of the
> bourgeoisie had produced apathy and even hostility toward public
> life not only, and not even primarily, in the social strata which
> were exploited and excluded from active participation in the rule of
> the country, but first of all in its own class.
