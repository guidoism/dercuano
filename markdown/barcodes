There are a bunch of 2-D barcode systems, with varying capacities.

PDF-417 is one of the older and better-known systems.  It can handle
up to 1108 bytes of binary data, and there are GPL PDF417 encoders and
decoders ---
<http://www.totalshareware.com/ASP/detail_view.asp?application=41548> is
“Grandzebu”’s Windows XP version, and then there’s
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdf417encode/> “pdf417_encode” by
“jtlien”.  There’s a “pdf417decode” as well at
<http://dataconv.org/apps_barcode.html> the “ooosawaddee3pdf417”
homepage --- this is a very slightly modified version of Ian
Goldberg’s 1997 decoder from
<http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/tools/pdf417-1.0.tar.gz> ---
unfortunately that software does not have a free license, or any
explicit license, actually.  There’s a SourceForge project at
sf.net/projects/pdf417decode which claims to be GPL but seems to be
the same unlicensed code, plus a bunch of new code to support error
correction.  There’s a reasonably nice description of how PDF-417
works at
<http://grandzebu.net/index.php?page=/informatique/codbar-en/pdf417.htm>.

DataMatrix/Semacode is a higher-capacity 2-D barcode, with up to 1556
bytes; I don’t know if it’s patent-safe.  There’s a GPL decoder in C#
at <http://datamatrixdec.berlios.de/index.php/Main_Page> with a couple
of releases from late 2006.

QR Code is the highest-capacity 2-D barcode in common use, with up to
2953 bytes (when it’s 177x177 pixels); with gzip -9, that’s enough
space to encode the Project Gutenberg version of Genesis up to Genesis
3:5, 1624 words. Denso-Wave has promised not to enforce its patents
against it.  There seems to be a lot of activity around it lately,
especially in Japan.  There’s a GPL decoder in Java at
<http://qrcode.sourceforge.jp/> or
<http://sourceforge.jp/projects/qrcode/> --- ThoughtWorks’s .NET library
doesn’t seem to be free software.  QR code is JIS-X-0510 and
ISO/IEC18004.  There’s a comprehensive introduction at
<http://www.denso-wave.com/qrcode/qrfeature-e.html> and an
occasionally-updated blog in Japanese at <http://www.qrcodeblog.com/>.
