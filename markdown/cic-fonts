The traditional way to compose the graphical things that make up
fonts, whether as outlines or as strokes, is to concatenate sequences
of lines, arcs, and Bézier curves.

I’ve thought about alternatives including decomposing those shapes
into splines and sine waves.  Now it occurs to me that maybe CIC
filters would also be a reasonable kind of way to decompose those
shapes.

The idea is that the path of a paintbrush painting the letter is some
kind of f(t) = (x, y) parametric curve, and CIC filters are capable of
producing fairly interesting parametric curves at pretty low
computational expense.  Maybe stroke width should also be part of it.
