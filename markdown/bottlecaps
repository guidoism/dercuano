Plastic bottlecaps are mostly compatible with each other because their
threads conform to a standard called PCO 1810, or occasionally PCO 28,
which is being [gradually replaced][6] by a newer standard called PCO
1881.  These threads are formed into the bottleneck (called a
“finish”) before the shape
of the rest of the bottle is formed; companies like [Jesper PET
Preform][0] will sell you the bottle “preform”, with the thread formed
but the rest of the bottle uninflated; then it’s up to you to
blow-mold the bottle into the shape you want.

The bottle caps (called “closures”) are sold separately, and they’re
usually made of polypropylene (“PP”).

PCO 1881 has a slightly shorter neck ([17mm instead of 21mm][2]) and
was finalized in 2009 by the [International Society of Beverage
Technologists][3].  It apparently implies no loss in performance
compared to the PCO-1810 standard, despite the steeper thread pitch
and the threads going around only twice instead of the three times you
see on PCO-1810 bottles.

Because the bottle neck and cap are so much thicker than the rest of
the plastic bottle, they account for a substantial fraction of the
material use in the bottle, so the [1.4 gram reduction due to the
4mm-shorter PCO-1881 standard amounts to 27%][1] of the total weight of
the PET bottle, not counting the cap.

ISBT has put the [PCO-1810 standard][5] and the [PCO-1881 standard][7]
engineering drawings [online along with their other standards][8], and
“ippe” [posted an STL file on Thingiverse][9] that prints to a working
PCO-1810 bottle closure at least in PLA on the Prusa Mendel I have
access to.  (You may want to turn that file upside down for printing
if you want it to seal, though; the top was too long a horizontal span
to cohere properly.)

In addition to the preforms, you can buy entire preblown bottles if
you don't have blow molding (“pressure molding”) equipment; a 43-gram
1ℓ bottle costs [around €0.36–€0.69][4] without the cap.
