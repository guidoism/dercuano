I opened my mailbox in Thunderbird.

- importing the mailbox is a pain
- had to create a dummy account first
- takes a number of minutes to open the mailbox
- uses 800-950MB of VM and 400+MB of `RPRVT` memory to open the mailbox
- sorts by default by date message claims to be sent, although there
  seem to be anomalies; this clusters spam
- uses 7-9 minutes of CPU to render a threaded view, during which time
  the UI is unresponsive; when you sort by something else and
  re-enable the threaded view, it takes another 7-9 minutes
- is there a way to hide the junk messages?
- I marked a bunch of messages as spam and a bunch of other messages
  as read in order to train the junk filter.  Then I (actually
  Beatrice) selected all messages with interesting-feature-A (which
  took less than a minute of CPU time, during which the UI was
  unresponsive) and selected "Run Junk Mail Controls on Folder" from
  the Tools menu.  This marked a number of the messages I'd marked as
  read, but not as spam, as spam.  There is no obvious way to
  distinguish the messages that I have marked as spam and the messages
  Thunderbird has marked as spam.
- on the plus side, Thunderbird doesn't seem to want to store its
  updates to message status flags as Status: headers in the messages.
- on the minus side, it seems to be storing that information in a
  176MB Mork file, which could make it hard to get it into anything
  else.
- Despite the fact that Thunderbird isn't storing
  which-message-is-read information in Status: headers, it seems to
  believe Status: headers added by spammers.
- Thunderbird thinks I have about 500 000 messages in this mailbox.
  But I actually have about 800 000.
- Scrollbars are not useful on a 500 000-item list.
