The miraculous low-rank SVD approximate convolution algorithm
=============================================================

When reading papers for file `convolution-bokeh`, I ran across a paper
by Tim McGraw on a powerful convolution algorithm.  The algorithm took
me a while to understand, and it turns out it isn’t original to
McGraw; it was extensively investigated in the 1970s and 1980s.  It’s
an absolutely astounding technique, and I think it has much broader
applicability than is widely appreciated.

Much of the below is somewhat speculative because *I've only just
tried the algorithm*.  It’s very possible I’m misunderstanding its
limitations.  But it gives me the first general attack on the problem
in `sparse-filters`, and I have a lot of reading to do!

The profound and wide-ranging importance of convolution
-------------------------------------------------------

The *convolution theorem* is one of the most important theorems in the
theory of signals (in the sense of “digital signal processing” or
“Signals & Systems”, not in some kind of semiotic sense).  It says
that any linear, shift-invariant system is fully characterized by its
impulse response, because you can add up a bunch of shifted and scaled
copies of that impulse response to compute its response to some
arbitrary signal.  (Or, in continuous domains, integrate.)  This has
applications both theoretical, in proving theorems generally
applicable to linear, shift-invariant systems, and applied, in
computing the result of a linear, shift-invariant system through one
or another convolution algorithm.

Significant linear, shift-invariant systems include nearly all
acoustic systems (in the time domain), circuits made of linear
components (voltage sources, current sources, resistors, transmission
lines, capacitors, and inductors — or their idealized versions,
anyway), nearly all optical systems in the time domain, and imaging
optics in the spatial domain as well.  Many systems that are not in
fact linear or shift-invariant can be locally approximated as linear
shift-invariant systems, though not all.  (You can’t get the Doppler
effect out of a locally-shift-invariant model, for example.)

Furthermore, because convolution in the space or time domain is
equivalent to pointwise multiplication in the frequency or Fourier
domain, we can do things like frequency filtering, blurring, and
sharpening by using convolution.

That point about “sharpening” deserves some sharpening.  In theory,
any convolution with no zeroes in the frequency domain, which is
mathematically almost all convolutions, has an inverse
convolution — you just take the reciprocal in the frequency domain and
Bob’s your auntie!  In theory this means that you can undo the
degradation caused by almost any known convolution (for example,
defocus blur) by applying an inverse convolution, a process known as
“deconvolution”.  However that inverse does not in general have a
finite impulse response.  And, because some frequency-domain
components of the original convolution may be very small indeed — the
high-frequency components of a blur, for example — their reciprocals
can be very large, which makes the problem ill-conditioned — that any
noise in those frequencies will be enormously amplified by the inverse
filter.  [Wiener filters] are the usual compromise solution to this
problem.

[Wiener filters]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter

> In two dimensions the impulse response is sometimes called the “point
spread function”, and sometimes, especially in imaging optics, it’s
also called the “output transfer function”.  In the context of
computing a convolution it’s also called a “kernel”.  Older papers
sometimes call it the “response function” or “amplitude response”.

Also, the probability distribution of a sum of random variables is the
convolution of the probability distribution of the individual random
variables, from which you should be able to see that convolution is
commutative and associative.  The damned thing just pops up
everywhere!

### Convolution defined mathematically ###

Mathematically, the definition of discrete convolution is almost
comically simple; using \* for convolution:

> (*f* \**g*)*ₜ* = Σ*ᵢ fᵢ gₜ*₋*ᵢ* = Σ*ᵢ fₜ*₋*ᵢ gᵢ*

Here *i* ranges over all possible values and *t* might be some
*D*-dimensional index as well as just an integer.  For example, when
we’re convolving images, it’s an (*x*, *y*) pair.  *g* might be the
impulse response (the “kernel”) of some system we’re simulating on
input *f*.  (You can easily verify that, if *f*₀ = 1 and *fₜ* = 0 for
all other *t* — that is, *f* is a discrete unit impulse — it merely
reproduces *g*.)

(Continuous convolution is the same thing but with an integral.)

### Yay convolution! ###

Despite this extremely broad spectrum of existing applications, I
think convolution is actually an underappreciated operation that could
be applied much more widely than it is.  See the “convolution” section
of file `powerful-primitives` and file `convolution-applications` for
more detail.  One reason it isn’t applied more broadly is that it’s
computationally pretty expensive.  And that’s where the earthshaking
discovery of SVD convolution comes in!

Singular-value decomposition convolution
----------------------------------------

XXX This section is repetitive

The amazing SVD convolution algorithm uses a “low-rank linear
approximation” to approximate convolutions of an image with arbitrary
kernels.  I first ran across it in [Fast Bokeh Effects Using Low-Rank
Linear
Filters](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~tmcgraw/papers/dof_mcgraw_2014.pdf)
(McGraw, 2014), where it’s used to simulate camera bokeh.  The basic
idea is that you approximate an arbitrary filter kernel, as McGraw
says, with a sum of a few separable kernels, which you derive by using
SVD (see below for a brief explanation if you’re as naïve about linear
algebra as I am) on the original kernel.  Usually most of the singular
values are very small, so you can throw them out.

The algorithm treats the rows and columns of the point spread function
you want to approximate as the rows and columns of a matrix, and then
uses the singular-value decomposition to find a “best” rank-*N*
approximation of that matrix.  You could think of this as
approximating each column of the filter kernel as a linear combination
of *N* principal-component columns, which are chosen to represent as
much column-to-column variation as possible.  (Or analogously for rows.)

There is nothing in SVD convolution that is specifically limited to
bokeh; it is a very general technique for efficiently approximating
any arbitrary two-dimensional convolution!  The speedup you can get
without unreasonable degradation depends very much on the kernel
you’re trying to approximate, but very often kernels contain
sufficient similarity between rows or columns to permit an excellent
approximation with only a few separable terms.

SVD convolution is specifically two-dimensional, because it relies on
the singular-value decomposition (SVD) to compute the *N* separable
filters whose sum is the least-squares-closest rank-*N* approximation
to the original filter kernel.  Each of these filters is represented
by a pair of vectors, one a horizontal convolution kernel and one a
vertical convolution kernel, whose outer product is a matrix that is
the convolution kernel of the composition of those convolutions.  The
sum of the *N* of these matrices corresponding to the *N* largest
singular values forms the optimal approximation.

In the bokeh paper, McGraw typically got visually very good results
with bokeh kernel approximations of rank 3 or greater.

### Singular-value decomposition (SVD) ###

(You can probably skip this if you know linear algebra well, but I
don’t.)

Singular-value decomposition is a generalization of eigendecomposition†
to nonsquare matrices; it decomposes some arbitrary matrix *M* as a
product of three matrices **M** = **UΣV\***, where **U** and **V** are
orthogonal (or more generally unitary) and **Σ** is diagonal.  One of
many interesting ways to view the result is as a series of
least-squares-optimal approximations of the original matrix whose
terms are *separable* matrices, meaning that they can be expressed as
the outer product of some pair of vectors.  Specifically, they are the
outer products of corresponding columns of **U** and **V**, scaled by
the members of the diagonal of **Σ**; because in general a matrix
product **AB** can be seen as the sum of the outer products of the
columns of **A** with the corresponding rows of **B**.

†*Eigendecomposition* is the decomposition of a square matrix using
its *eigenvectors*, a term whose only advantage is as a shibboleth for
exposing Malcolm Gladwell — the Spanish term *autovector* is much more
informative.  I only mentioned this because if you already know about
eigenvectors, the above explanation of SVD will be easier to
understand.

Since those columns of **U** and **V** are unit vectors, the elements
of **Σ** are what tell you how big the contribution of each of these
separable matrices is to the final matrix sum, so you can get the best
*N*-term approximation by taking the columns corresponding to the *N*
largest elements of **Σ**, which are by convention ordered to be
first.  It turns out that this is the optimal *N*-term approximation
in the sense of the Frobenius norm — that is, in the sense of
differing by a matrix with the smallest Frobenius norm (the sum of
squares of all the elements).

In Numpy the SVD is found at numpy.linalg.svd, which is a wrapper
around LAPACK’s `*gesdd`, which mostly works by calling `*bdsdc`, both
by Ming Gu and Huan Ren.  (The `*` is the data type in question.)

### Separable filters ###

A separable filter is a two-dimensional convolution you can compute by
first doing a one-dimensional convolution on each row and then doing a
one-dimensional convolution on each column of that result.  (Or vice
versa, since, as it turns out, convolutions commute.)  This is great
because if you have a convolution kernel that is *w*×*h* and you try
to calculate the convolution by brute force, you need *w*·*h*
multiply-accumulates per pixel, but you can do a separable filter with
just *w* + *h* multiply-accumulates per pixel.  So if you have an
11×11 kernel you can get by with 22 multiply-accumulates instead of
121.  Big win!

(That is, your horizontal one-dimensional convolution uses 11
multiply-accumulates on pixels in the same scan line to calculate each
pixel of the intermediate image, and then the vertical one-dimensional
convolution uses 11 multiply-accumulates on intermediate-image pixels
in the same column to calculate each pixel of the final image — 22 in
all.)

It turns out that doing this pair of 1-D convolutions is equivalent to
doing a 2-D convolution with the outer product of the two convolution
kernels, as you can easily calculate.

There are three very popular separable 2-D filters: box filters,
double-exponential filters, and Gaussian filters.  Box filters and
double-exponential filters are popular because you can calculate them
in just a few operations per pixel, like, about three along each axis.
Gaussian filters are popular because they’re circularly symmetric, and
they’re the *only* separable circularly symmetric filters; also, there
are a fair number of physical phenomena with Gaussian behavior, but
they get applied pretty often in wildly inappropriate ways.  The most
common way to approximate a Gaussian filter is actually to run a few
iterations of one of the other two, which works because of the Law of
Large Numbers.

Since the outer product of two vectors *u* ⊗ *v* is separable in this
way, and any matrix product **UV** is a sum of separable terms — each
the outer product of a column of **U** and the corresponding row of
**V** — any decomposition of your convolution kernel into a product of
two matrices gives you a way to express it as a sum of separable
kernels.  The outstanding advantage of SVD is that it gives us a
decomposition where *as much as possible* of the result comes from *as
few as possible* of these outer-product terms.

History
-------

As I said above, SVD convolution was explored extensively in the 1970s
and 1980s.  The seminal paper is probably Treitel and Shanks, “The
Design of Multistage Separable Planar Filters”, in 1971:

> A two-dimensional, or planar, digital filter can be described in
> terms of its planar response function, which is in the form of a
> matrix of weighting coefficients, or filter array.  In many
> instances the dimensions of these matrices are so large that their
> implementation as ordinary planar convolutional filters becomes
> computationally inefficient.  It is possible to expand the given
> coefficient matrix into a finite and convergent sum of matrix-valued
> stages.  Each stage can be separated with no error into the product
> of an *m*-length column vector multiplied into an *n*-length row
> vector, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of
> columns of the original filter array.  Substantial savings in

> the one-dimensional sequences described by these vectors are in turn
> approximated by one-dimensional recursive filters.  Two geophysical
> examples have been selected to illustrate how the present design
> techniques may be reduced to practice.

The paper doesn’t use the term “singular-value decomposition”, perhaps
because it was new at the time, instead explaining how to derive the
SVD from eigendecomposition.  By 1975 papers were using the term.

In 1980 Sang Uk Lee did his dissertation on it, “Design of SVD/SGK
Convolution Filters for Image Processing”, citing Treitel and Shanks
1971 and also Twogood and Mitra’s 1977 “Computer-Aided Design of
Separable Two-Dimensional Digital Filters”, which also cites Treitel
and Shanks.  Andreas Antoniou and what I assume are his students, such
as Wu-Sheng LU and Hui-Ping WANG, continued publishing on the subject
through the 1980s, and, for example, in 1990 published “Design of
Two-Dimensional FIR Digital Filters by Using the Singular-Value
Decomposition”, in which they find ways to further modify the filter
to decrease the computational load, one using LU decomposition.

Mitra, Grosen, and Neuvo published a couple of papers in 1985 on
extending the algorithm to one-dimensional signals by partitioning
them into equal-sized chunks.

Work continues today, perhaps at a reduced pace; Atkins, Strauss, and
Zhang published “Approximate convolution using partitioned truncated
singular value decomposition filtering for binaural rendering” in 2013
on a way to filter audio to produce the binaural sensation of space,
and in 2014 McGraw published the paper where I learned about the
technique.  McGraw doesn’t cite this earlier work and seems to be
unaware of it; he may have invented the technique independently 40
years later.

Of all of the above, I find Lee’s dissertation to be by far the most
readable, perhaps in part because it’s jargon-compatible with me.  The
earlier work largely uses terminology I find confusing, and the later
work assumes familiarity with the earlier work.  The Treitel–Shanks
paper is a close second, despite the alien jargon, because it’s very
well written, but of course it only covers developments up to 1971.

A toy example
-------------

With Numpy and SciPy, it’s pretty easy to test the algorithm out; the
following took me about half an hour with IPython.  It’s probably
better to use IPython or Jupyter, with `%pylab inline`, so you can use
`matshow` to see the values as images.

First, let’s compute a flat circular convolution kernel, like a
typical camera bokeh:

    >>> import scipy.signal
    >>> import numpy.linalg
    >>> import numpy
    >>> r = range(-8, 9)
    >>> x, y = numpy.meshgrid(r, r)
    >>> circle = (x**2 + y**2 < 64)
    >>> # matshow(circle)
    >>> print('\n'.join(''.join(map(str, 0 + row)) for row in circle))
    00000000000000000
    00000111111100000
    00011111111111000
    00111111111111100
    00111111111111100
    01111111111111110
    01111111111111110
    01111111111111110
    01111111111111110
    01111111111111110
    01111111111111110
    01111111111111110
    00111111111111100
    00111111111111100
    00011111111111000
    00000111111100000
    00000000000000000

Let’s generate an image to convolve with that circle kernel — all zero
except for a couple of bright points at (2, 2) and (8, 13).  Numpy
array coordinates are in (row, column) order, which is to say, (y, x).

    >>> p = numpy.zeros((16, 16))
    >>> p[2, 2] = 3
    >>> p[8, 13] = 2
    >>> # matshow(p)
    >>> p
    array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],

           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 2., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])

We can do the convolution with brute force using
scipy.signal.convolve2d:

    >>> perfect = scipy.signal.convolve2d(p, circle)
    >>> # matshow(perfect)
    >>> print('\n'.join(''.join(map(str, row.astype(int))) for row in perfect))

    array([0., 0., 0., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 3., 5., 5., 5.,
           5., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 2., 0., 0., 0.])

Now let’s compute the same result using SVD convolution instead.

As it happens, at 17×17, the circle only has four distinct nonzero
columns, so, considered as a matrix, its rank is 4.  Consequently, it
has four nonzero singular values, not counting rounding errors:

    >>> u, s, v = numpy.linalg.svd(circle)
    >>> s
    array([1.33371921e+01, 3.01484321e+00, 2.04182621e+00, 1.36417508e+00,
           3.34375584e-16, 1.28668530e-16, 7.48637395e-17, 3.74505958e-17,
           5.96041076e-32, 4.06050202e-33, 3.67797309e-33, 5.31269989e-34,
           2.72274806e-49, 1.79207201e-49, 1.91581056e-50, 0.00000000e+00,
           0.00000000e+00])

numpy.linalg.svd gives us **Σ** as a vector, as seen above, and **V**
in its transposed form ready to multiply.  So we can, for example,
reconstruct a rank-3 approximation of the circle and measure its error
as follows:

    >>> circle3 = (u[..., :3] * s[:3]).dot(v[:3, ...])
    >>> # matshow(circle3)
    >>> ((circle3 - circle)**2).sum(), (circle**2).sum()
    (1.8609736397047545, 193)

We can use the same brute-force approach to convolve this
approximation with the image, which doesn’t save us any computation
time, but does validate that the low-rank approximation, this sum of
three separable kernels, does some kind of a reasonable approximation:

    >>> approx3 = scipy.signal.convolve2d(p, circle3)
    >>> # matshow(approx3)
    >>> approx3.max(axis=1)
    array([0.        , 0.        , 0.        , 2.96621523, 3.09214447,

           4.69144233, 5.27890672, 5.27890672, 5.06351288, 5.34157302,

So now let’s try the algorithm more or less for real.  First, we
convolve each column of **U** with each row of our picture `p`, thus
getting one horizontally-convolved intermediate image for each term of
our approximation.  There’s probably a way to do this purely with
Numpy without using Python interpretive `for` looping:

    >>> hterms = numpy.array([[s[j] * numpy.convolve(u[..., j], p[i])
                           for i in range(len(p))]
                          for j in range(len(u[0]))])
    >>> #matshow(hterms[0])

Here are a couple of rows from the first approximation term:

    >>> hterms[0][1:3]
    array([[  0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ],
           [  0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,  -6.00495857,
             -9.16629667, -10.54084337, -10.54084337, -11.44132655,
            -11.44132655, -11.44132655, -11.44132655, -11.44132655,
            -11.44132655, -11.44132655, -10.54084337, -10.54084337,
             -9.16629667,  -6.00495857,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,
              0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ,   0.        ]])

Then we can convolve each row of `v` (**V\***) with each *column* of
its corresponding intermediate image, thus generating a stack of
images that are the terms of our approximation; the sum of the first
three of these is equal to the result of our brute-force convolution
with the approximation from earlier, except for rounding error:

    >>> terms = numpy.array([numpy.array([numpy.convolve(v[j], hterm.T[i])
                             for i in range(len(hterm.T))]).T
                            for j, hterm in enumerate(hterms)])
    >>> approx3_fast = terms[0:3].sum(axis=0)
    >>> # matshow(approx3_fast)
    >>> abs(approx3_fast - approx3).max()
    4.884981308350689e-15

And, because our kernel in this case is only of rank 4, the rank-4
approximation, summing four separable kernels, is exactly equal to the
correct convolution result, again except for rounding error:

    >>> abs(terms[0:4].sum(axis=0) - perfect).sum()
    4.3509640335059885e-13

I say that was *more or less* for real because I calculated all the
terms, not just the first four terms that I used, and I was using
interpretive loops rather than trying to get `convolve2d` to do
one-dimensional convolutions, so running it exactly as above on a
larger image would be *slower* than the brute-force approach.

Direct applications
-------------------

SVD convolution can be applied directly to sharpening and blurring
images, to Wiener filtering of images that have been corrupted by
suboptimal optics, to object recognition and convolutional feature
extraction in images, and to computing approximations of the
performance of optical systems.  In the context of mathematical
optimization, for example of simulated optical systems, a
computationally inexpensive approximation is immensely valuable,
because it allows many more optimization cycles to run.

For applications like object recognition in images, it’s common to
have many more candidate filter kernels than images.  In this case, it
might be more productive to use a low-rank approximation of the
original image rather than of the filter kernels, which is guaranteed
to work because convolution is commutative.

Extensions
----------

What useful extensions of SVD convolution might be possible, but
aren’t simply straightforward applications of it?

### To more dimensions ###

The *D*-dimensional equivalent problem is well-posed: find *N*
sequences of *D* vectors whose *D*-dimensional outer products sum to
form the optimal approximation to the original *D*-dimensional
convolution kernel.  It can’t be solved directly with SVD, but maybe
there’s a way to apply SVD more indirectly to a couple of dimensions
at a time, or maybe you could use a recursive iterative-approximation
algorithm that subtracts off the *D*-dimensional outer product of the
average vectors of the residual along each dimension.  If not, I’m
optimistic that, e.g., gradient-descent variants like Adam or
quasi-Newton methods are sufficiently powerful to find a good
solution.

I ran across a 2009 paper by Oseledets and Tyrtyshnikov, “Breaking the
curse of dimensionality, or how to use SVD in many dimensions”, which
explains something called “the *Tree-Tucker* format” using “Tucker
decomposition”; this sounds similar to the above.  I haven’t finished
reading it.

### To one dimension ###

If *D* = 1, then the problem as posed above is trivial: the
convolution kernel is a vector, and it is its own best vector
approximation, *N* = 1.  To get a more useful result, we would need to
find a way of somehow approximating the convolution with shorter
vectors.

One possibility is to “word-wrap” or “raster” a one-dimensional
time-domain sequence of *a*·*b* points into a two-dimensional signal
of dimensions *a* × *b* where *a* is small compared to the size of our
desired kernel, ideally close to its square root.  Then you raster the
kernel analogously into an *a* × *c* shape.  If you do wraparound onto
the previous and next *a*-element “scan line”, a two-dimensional
convolution on these two-dimensional signals is precisely the same
thing as the original one-dimensional convolution.  If the kernel has
substantial periodicity, the way bandpass convolution filters do, SVD
may yield a good low-rank approximation if *a* is a multiple of its
period.  But if the columns of the kernel are perfectly uncorrelated,
no good low-rank approximation will exist.

So, computing the original time-domain convolution by brute force
required *ac* multiply-accumulates per sample, and now we can do it in
*a* + *c* multiply-accumulates per sample per term — if we’re using a
rank-3 approximation, 3(*a* + *c*) multiply-accumulates per sample.
This is a win if 3(*a* + *c*) < *ac* — if *a* ≈ *c*, that’s roughly
6*a* < *a*², which is true if *a* > 6, or more generally, is more than
twice the rank of the approximation.

Unwrapping the above computation back into one dimension, we can view
each term of this algorithm as first doing a size-*a* one-dimensional
convolution, then a *sparse* size-*ac* one-dimensional convolution,
with *c* taps at intervals of *a*.

(I think all of the above is in the Atkins et al. paper from 2013 that
I mentioned above, but I haven’t really read it yet.)

A key observation here is that there’s no particular reason for these
terms to use the same value of *a*, and in fact it’s probably
advantageous for them to use *different* values of *a*, because the
first pass using *a*₀ will probably suck up most of the energy at
frequencies that fit neatly into *a*₀ — the residual error will be
particularly low around those frequencies.  So it might be a good idea
to use a sequence of strides *a*₁, *a*₂, etc., zero-padding the kernel
if necessary, to get a better “low-rank” approximation.  The
autocorrelation function of the residual kernel is probably a good
guide to picking those strides, although this greedy algorithm might
not produce optimal results.

Also, since this reduces one linear convolution to two or more cheaper
linear convolutions, it can be applied recursively — for example, you
could reduce a 1000-tap kernel to a 10-tap kernel and a 100-tap
kernel, then reduce the 100-tap kernel to two 10-tap kernels.  This is
clearly cheaper to compute if you’re only using the first vector from
the SVD, but you might need more than one!  If you use more, we’re not
talking about *two* 10-tap kernels in the final stage, but about
*many* final 10-tap kernels — 4 of them if you use two components each
time.  Still a big win — 2·10 + 4·10 + 4·10 = 100, much less than
1000 — but less so.

If you do this kind of recursive decomposition (which, incidentally,
can also be used on the one-dimensional kernels that result from the
two-dimensional algorithm), the SVD no longer gives you fully optimal
results, because you aren’t precisely using the first principal
components — you’re using some approximation to them, leaving some
extra error.  This suggests that some kind of iterative algorithm like
the greedy algorithm described above will probably produce better
results.

(I think you can probably approximate the first principal component
reasonably efficiently by using the PageRank algorithm on **M\*M** and
**MM\*** to get their largest eigenvectors, rather than computing the
full SVD.)

### On prefix-sum images (uh, probably not) ###

One of the annoying features of the low-rank approximations produced
by SVD is that they don’t deal very well with diagonal edges or
gradients in the kernel.  I wonder if you could “precondition” the
image by running horizontal and vertical prefix sums on it (allowing
wraparound on overflow) and apply compensating finite-difference
operators *on the kernel* before computing the SVD approximation.
Without the approximation step, this would be precisely equivalent,
because the integration and differentiation operators cancel, and
convolution is associative.  But perhaps by removing the large-scale
structure from the kernel, leaving more local differences, the SVD
approximation would have less error.

As an extreme example, consider a kernel like this contrived rank-5
specimen:

     1  2  3  4  5
     2  4  6  8 10
     3  6  9 12 15
     4  8 12 16 20
     5 10 15 20 25

Upon applying a horizontal backward differences operator to it (the
inverse of horizontal prefix sum), you get this rank-1 result:

     1  1  1  1  1
     2  2  2  2  2
     3  3  3  3  3
     4  4  4  4  4
     5  5  5  5  5

And on differencing that vertically, you get this singular matrix:

     1  1  1  1  1
     1  1  1  1  1
     1  1  1  1  1
     1  1  1  1  1
     1  1  1  1  1

This kernel is clearly much easier to represent.

I’m very much not sure that this would help, though; I think it
depends on the kinds of features you find in kernels.

(P.S. I tried it on a kernel like the circle bokeh kernel above.  It
made the approximation enormously worse.)
