Instead of salt-firing ceramic to glaze it, could you glaze it by
producing a sodium-containing plasma on or just above its surface?
For example, you could blow powdered sodium chloride into a plasma arc
to vaporize it, or you could generate the arc from consumable wire
electrodes embedded in a solid rod of sodium chloride, perhaps mixed
with fillers to add gas volume — for example, sodium bicarbonate
(which would also serve as a chlorine-free source of sodium, but might
produce carbon), sodium nitrate (which wouldn’t produce carbon but
would produce nitrogen oxides that are worse than chlorine), boric
acid, or sodium borate (borax).
