Photovoltaic cells are generally made with a PIN structure, with a
large undoped intrinsic region between the P and N doped regions.  I
think that such a PIN diode, when back-biased (the normal case with a
photovoltaic cell) will conduct like the avalanche tube of a Geiger
counter when exposed to gamma rays or some other kinds of
radioactivity.

There are cheaper PIN diodes available than solar cells, but for
detecting radioactivity, a large total area is advantageous.

opengeiger.de has an open design for a PIN-diode-based Geiger counter
using a low-capacitance PIN diode.

Probably the most practical radioactivity sources for testing such a
Geiger counter are radioactive fluorescent light starters (now,
thankfully, becoming obsolete) and supermarket potassium chloride,
which emits mostly Î² particles and some gamma rays.
