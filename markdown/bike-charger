What would it take to recharge your laptop and other electronic
devices by riding your bike?  There are highly efficient and reliable
dynohubs these days.  You could mount a small lead-acid gel cell
battery on your bike and charge it by riding.

A regular car or motorcyle battery holds in the tens of kJ up to MJ.
The Wikipedia article for "Car battery" says 30–40 Wh/kg, around 100
kJ/kg.  My netbook battery says:

    $ acpi -i
    Battery 0: design capacity 5246 mAh, last full capacity 4518 mAh = 86%

It's, I think, 11 volts at the moment, which means it had about 200 kJ
when full.  So you'd need about 2kg of lead-acid battery to hold a
full recharge for it, plus some small, lightweight electronics like a
buck-boost converter to supply the laptop with the 19 volts it wants
for recharging.

Amazon has a [£17 lead-acid battery][1] with 10Ah at 12V, or 400kJ.
At the moment £17 is US$27.  (Typical prices seem a bit higher.)  It
weighs 3.3kg.  If everything scaled linearly, a 200kJ lead-acid
battery would weigh 1.7kg and cost US$14.

At a substantial cost in reliability, safety, and money, you could use
the laptop battery directly.  I think it weighs more like 500 g, but
it costs more like US$100.

A [bike dynamo hub][0] like the Schmidt SON28 consumes some 2–6 W of
mechanical power, and probably has efficiency in the 80%-99% range.
Getting 200 kJ out of 4 W would require almost 14 hours of riding,
which I think of as two to four days' worth.

A modular display strategy would be very useful: several
cellphone-style displays would both be easier to protect against
breakage and allow scaling power usage up and down as needed.
