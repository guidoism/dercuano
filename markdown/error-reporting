Error Reporting is Part of the Programmer's User Interface
==========================================================

(This is about the user interface provided to the application
programmer, not the user interface the application programmer provides
to the non-programmer.)

I have a quibble with the user interface design approach of
[web.py](http://webpy.org/).  Its user interface design slogan says:

> "Think about the ideal way to write a web app.
> Write the code to make it happen."

And in [a February 2006 post on the web.py mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/webpy/msg/f266701d97e7ceb1):

> The goal of web.py is to build the ideal way to make web apps. If

This is a very respectable user-interface-design philosophy: start
from a conception of the user interface, and then proceed to write the
code to make the user interface work.  I totally agree with this point
of view.

Unfortunately, the user interface for a library doesn't just include
the code you have to write to use the library; it also includes
implicit coupling created between parts of that code, and the error
messages produced when your code is wrong.  And web.py doesn't do very
well on those latter items, because of hyper-optimizing the code you
have to write --- to the point of being deceptive.

The fundamental merit that is somewhat lacking is that of explicitness;
[explicit is better than implicit][], because explicitly stating the
relationships in your program makes them both comprehensible to a reader
and changeable by a maintainer.  Implicit relationships are neither.
Also, explicitly stating relationships allows errors in these
relationships to be reported in the terms of the user's model (the 
[green code][]) rather than the implementation model (the yellow code).

An Example of the Problem
-------------------------

I'm developing on top of web.py 0.3, which hasn't been released yet.
Here I'm trying to reproduce an example from the docstring of
`web.application.request`, but with `web.config.debug` turned on.

    kragen@thrifty:~/devel/watchdog-git$ python
    Python 2.4.4 (#2, Apr  5 2007, 20:11:18) 
    [GCC 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import web
    >>> web.config.debug = True
    >>> urls = ("/hello", "hello")
    >>> class hello:
    ...     def GET(self):
    ...         web.header('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
    ...         return "hello"
    ... 
    >>> app = web.application(urls, globals())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
      File "/home/kragen/devel/webpy.dev/web/application.py", line 62, in __init__
        module_name = modname(fvars)
      File "/home/kragen/devel/webpy.dev/web/application.py", line 54, in modname
        file, name = fvars['__file__'], fvars['__name__']
    KeyError: '__file__'
    >>> 

This error leads me to wonder, "WTF?"  This is not an error phrased in
terms of anything I passed in to web.py.  And it only occurs when
`web.config.debug` is turned on.

It turns out that the problem is that, when `autoreload` is true,
`web.application.__init__` tries to reload the module that contains
the `urls` and `mapping` arguments I'm passing in, and it does so by
assuming that the `mapping` is the `globals()` of some module loaded
from a file and therefore will contains a `__file__` key that tells
where to find that file.

Here's another test case that shows a related problem, this time in a
file:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import web

    class hello:
        def GET(self):
            web.header('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
            return "hello"

    def main():
        web.config.debug = True
        urls = ("/hello", "hello")
        app = web.application(urls, globals())
        app.request("/hello")

    if __name__ == '__main__': main()

This gives the following error, which you'll note is several times
longer than the program itself --- actually two errors:

        raise NameError, 'could not find %s (line %s)' % (repr(i[NAME]), i[LINENO])
    NameError: could not find 'x' (line 178)

Again, I didn't pass in anything called "x"; I never asked web.py
anything about "x"; and I didn't pass in any non-string things that
could reasonably be used as dict keys.  It turns out that in order to
get the auto-reloading logic to work, web.py is rooting through the
globals of the specified module in order to find the `mapping`
argument I passed in, so that it can reload `mapping` from that module
after it reloads the module.

This is an example of what is wrong with "magic".  The error is rather
confusing for the user to debug, at least if they're kind of dumb like
me, because the web.py API being called makes all sorts of hidden
assumptions about the arguments and the relationships between them.  The
API leads you to believe that it is called with some arbitrary mapping
and a dictionary to look up keys from the mapping, but that's a lie.  At
least when you have `debug` turned on, it really needs a module and a
global variable name in that module, in order to support auto-reloading.
It's just sneaky about it, and produces incomprehensible error messages.

The solution, for what it's worth, is to instantiate the
`web.application` with `autoreload` turned off:

    app = web.application(urls, globals(), autoreload=False)

The Cost In The Yellow Code
---------------------------

It's not just that this magic makes it harder to write and debug
applications on top of web.py.  It also makes web.py itself harder to
understand.  Here's the code in `web.application.__init__` to do this
magic:

            if autoreload:
                def modname(fvars):
                    """find name of the module name from fvars."""
                    file, name = fvars['__file__'], fvars['__name__']
                    if name == '__main__':
                        # Since the __main__ module can't be reloaded, the module has 
                        # to be imported using its file name.                    
                        name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(file))[0]
                    return name

                mapping_name = utils.dictfind(fvars, mapping)
                module_name = modname(fvars)

                def reload_mapping():
                    """loadhook to reload mapping and fvars."""
                    mod = __import__(module_name)
                    self.fvars = mod.__dict__
                    self.mapping = getattr(mod, mapping_name)

                # to reload modified modules
                self.add_processor(loadhook(Reloader()))

                # to update mapping and fvars
                self.add_processor(loadhook(reload_mapping))

Here's what I think it would look like if you passed in `module_name`
and `mapping_name` directly:

            if autoreload:
                def reload_mapping():
                    """loadhook to reload mapping and fvars."""
                    mod = __import__(module_name)
                    self.fvars = mod.__dict__
                    self.mapping = getattr(mod, mapping_name)

                # to reload modified modules
                self.add_processor(loadhook(Reloader()))

                # to update mapping and fvars
                self.add_processor(loadhook(reload_mapping))

Additionally there's copy-and-pasted code in `web.webpyfunc`.  Here's
what it looks like now:

        if not hasattr(inp, '__call__'):
            if autoreload:
                def modname():
                    """find name of the module name from fvars."""
                    file, name = fvars['__file__'], fvars['__name__']
                    if name == '__main__':
                        # Since the __main__ module can't be reloaded, the module has 
                        # to be imported using its file name.
                        name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(file))[0]
                    return name

                mod = __import__(modname(), None, None, [""])
                #@@probably should replace this with some inspect magic
                name = utils.dictfind(fvars, inp)
                func = lambda: handle(getattr(mod, name), mod)
            else:
                func = lambda: handle(inp, fvars)
        else:
            func = inp

I don't completely understand this, but I think that with a more
honest interface, all that code would look more like this:

    func = lambda: handle(getattr(__import__(modname, None, None, [""]), name),
                          inp)

This would enable the removal of `web.utils.dictfind`:

    def dictfind(dictionary, element):
        """
        Returns a key whose value in `dictionary` is `element` 
        or, if none exists, None.

            >>> d = {1:2, 3:4}
            >>> dictfind(d, 4)
            3
            >>> dictfind(d, 5)
        """
        for (key, value) in dictionary.iteritems():
            if element is value: 
                return key

That's about 30-50 lines of code to implement this single misfeature,
which could be removed with a simple interface change.

The (Lack of) Benefit in the Green Code
---------------------------------------

But how much does all that extra complexity above shorten the code you
have to write to use the library?  (I've argued above that it actually
makes the application code harder to write, although shorter, because it
renders important dependencies invisible.)

If the interface were changed as I suggest, the cost to user code
would be that instead of writing this:

    app = web.application(urls, globals())

You would write this:

    import mywebapp
    app = web.appreloader(mywebapp, 'urls')

Or, if you standardized on the name `'urls'` (which is what most
web.py apps call the mapping) it would just be:

    import mywebapp
    app = web.appreloader(mywebapp)

But I think that, in this case, [explicit is better than implicit][].

Global Variables: Another Example
---------------------------------

I originally ran into the above problem not because I was manually
setting `web.config.debug` to `True` in Python's REPL, but rather
because I was writing post-hoc unit tests for a web app that did
(<http://watchdog.net/>).  That app set `web.config.debug` to `True`
when it was imported.  This violates the normal Python principle that
you should be able to import a module without fear, but there doesn't
seem to be another solution with web.py.  In order to work around some
of the bad effects of storing state in global variables, web.py uses
`ThreadedDict`s so that HTTP requests in different threads don't
interfere with each other.

Reporting Problems in the Terms of the User's Model
---------------------------------------------------

Above I said that being explicit instead of implicit makes it possible
to "report problems in the terms of the user's model".  Here's an
example of what that means, from another context, where the user is the
programmer in a language, not the caller of a library.  Here's a small
Python program that forgets to check its inputs:

    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ cat > len.py
    import sys
    print len(sys.argv[1])    # print length of first command-line argument
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ python len.py  # note: no command-line arguments
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "len.py", line 2, in ?
        print len(sys.argv[1])
    IndexError: list index out of range

That's pretty straightforward.  It shows you the broken line of code and
tells you that what it's doing is trying to index into a list
(`sys.argv`), but the supplied list index is off the end of that list.
Both the list and the index are objects in the world of the Python
programmer, the user of Python; they appear in the program.

How about in C?

In C, we don't have lists; instead we have mostly machine words with
associated types.  Any connection between the starting address of an
array and the number of items in the array is necessarily implicit.
(There are things like `valgrind` that can sometimes tell you if you
violate array bounds, but the ANSI standard requires the compiler to
allow some kinds of pointer arithmetic outside of array bounds.)
Consequently the C runtime can't report such an error in the terms of
the source C program (that is, the terms of the user of the C compiler);
it has to report it in terms of the implementation of C.

So here's the same program in C:

    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ cat > len.c
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
      printf("%d\n", strlen(argv[1]));
      return 0;
    }
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ gcc -Wall len.c -o len
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ ./len
    Segmentation fault

That's not a very helpful error message, but we can do better.

    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ gcc -Wall -g -O0 len.c -o len
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ ./len
    Segmentation fault
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ gdb len

So now we know what line the error happened at (although this is not
always possible in C) but it still isn't telling us that it was a
pointer arithmetic error.  To find that, we have to descend to the
implementation level, which happens to be x86 assembly.  Here's `main`:

    End of assembler dump.

OK, but where are we?

    (gdb) x/i $pc
    0x804837c <main+40>:	repnz scas %es:(%edi),%al

`repnz scas` is what `gcc` compiles `strlen` to, so the problem is the
argument of `strlen`.  It reads from where `%edi` points.  So `%edi`
must be pointing somewhere bogus.

    (gdb) x/a $edi
    0x0:	Cannot access memory at address 0x0

Aha, `%edi` is a null pointer.  So we probably passed a null pointer to
`strlen`.  Where did that come from?

    (gdb) x/a argv
    Cannot access memory at address 0x3
    (gdb) p argv
    Cannot access memory at address 0x3
    (gdb) info locals
    No locals.
    (gdb) info args
    argc = Cannot access memory at address 0xffffffff

Looks like our `argv` got horked.  Oh well, too bad.  We know the
problem is that `argv[1]` was null.

    (gdb) q
    The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y

There is a striking family resemblance between the debugger session
above and the process required to comprehend the web.py error:

    TypeError: getattr(): attribute name must be string

It took me something like half an hour to figure out what was going on
there.  Probably if I were smart, it would have been more like five
minutes, but in either case, the entire class of such hard-to-diagnose
errors could be avoided by interface design that's explicit enough to
report errors in the terms of the user's model.
