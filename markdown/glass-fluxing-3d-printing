Suppose you do a powder-bed 3-D printing process where the binder you
deposit is a flux that lowers the melting and sintering temperatures
of the powder filler, then bake the block at a temperature high enough
to sinter or melt the binder-modified part of the structure.  This
might make 3D printing in new, unusual, or very inexpensive materials
feasible.

The baseline I’m coming from here is that a spool of fucking PLA on
Amazon [goes for fucking US$23/kg.][21]  And, yeah, PLA is light and
dimensionally stable and doesn’t require your hotend to get super hot
(180° is enough), but it’s also pretty weak (50 MPa), and it sure
takes a long time to come out of that teeny little hole.

Soda-lime glass
---------------

There are many possible binder-filler systems that could be used, but
the one that seems most promising to me at the moment would use quartz
sand as the filler and a mixture of sodium and calcium carbonates as
the binder, forming soda-lime glass.  [Soda-lime glass][5] has a glass
transition temperature of about 570°, and so sintering should be
possible a bit below that, while unfluxed quartz melts at 1670°.  With
1100° of headroom, it should be very easy to keep the kiln temperature
in the range required to sinter or melt only the fluxed part, not the
unused filler.  Indeed, it might be possible to [pit-fire][2] the
piece, which typically reaches heats between 1000° and 1200°.

[2]: http://www.ceramicstoday.com/howto/htpitfire.htm
[5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda-lime_glass

The usual mixture for soda-lime glass is about 73% silica, 13% sodium
oxide, 10% calcium oxide, and 4% other impurities.  Sodium and calcium
carbonates, which are themselves fairly safe to handle, decompose to
form these caustic oxides at 851° and 840°, respectively, though I
suspect the presence of quartz will lower the required temperature.
Sodium bicarbonate (aka sodium hydrogen carbonate), which is even
safer to handle, decomposes to sodium carbonate starting at 50°,
releasing water and CO₂.  All of these ingredients are safe enough
that they are used in cooking.

If calcium is omitted, the resulting “[waterglass][3]” material is
water-soluble at high temperatures; this may not be a concern,
depending on the application.  The potential advantage of this method
would be that [sodium carbonate][0] and [bicarbonate][1] are
water-soluble, up to about 5% or 10% in warm water.  However, that
isn’t enough to properly flux the quartz, so it will have to be
applied in solid form.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate
[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_silicate

You could have [a robot with a valved funnel][4] carefully dribbling
the appropriate amount of mixed carbonates onto each layer of silica
sand, or you could have an entire row of such nozzles.

Soda-lime glass doesn’t start to flow freely until about 1000°, so as
long as the temperature doesn’t get that high, the fluxed part of the
print won’t soak into the rest of the unused filler too badly.

[Lead glass][6] might be an alternative: rather than calcium, you use
[lead(II) oxide][7] (or, with air, [galena][8] or just plain lead),
and rather than sodium oxide, you use [potassium oxide][9], or in
practice, [potassium carbonate][10].  Lead glass, however, is less
viscous than soda-lime glass, which is undesirable in this case, and
doesn’t have a lower softening point (still around 600°).

Feldspar?
---------

The only mineral more common (and thus, I hope, cheaper) than quartz
is feldspar, or rather, the feldspars, which melt at a wide variety of
temperatures, [from 600° to 1200°][11].  I’m not sure what, if
anything, to flux them with, other than quartz itself.  I guess
[calcium-rich plagioclase can be fluxed with sodium-rich
plagioclase][12].

[11]: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/meltrock.html
[12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen%27s_reaction_series

Sodium and potassium feldspars are [traditionally used as fluxes][37]
in pottery to vitrify silica and [boron trioxide][38], so in a sense
this is just a slightly different angle on the soda-lime glass from
the previous section.

[38]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_trioxide

Alumina ceramic
---------------

[Alumina][32] (aluminum oxide, also known as ruby or sapphire) is the
hardest mineral commonly used in ceramics, because the harder diamond
and [carborundum][33] (silicon carbide) are tricky to deal with,
[cubic boron nitride][34] is expensive (I think?), and tungsten
carbide is about as hard as alumina, but more expensive.

[32]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide
[33]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide
[34]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_nitride#Cubic_boron_nitride

Alumina doesn’t melt until the truly unreasonably hot 2072°, which was
a great difficulty in the development of the [Hall-Héroult
process][35] that converted aluminum from a precious metal into a
cheaper substitute for steel.  The trick that made it feasible was
fluxing the alumina in [cryolite][36], Na₃AlF₆, so that the mix melts
at only 1000°.

[35]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process
[36]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryolite

So you could imagine fluxing an alumina powder bed with just enough
cryolite to get the grains to sinter together into a glass at around
1000°.  You can probably do this with an arbitrarily small amount of
cryolite; it melts at 1012°, and I believe it will wet the alumina
grains immediately and begin to dissolve them, recrystallizing or
vitrifying upon cooling.  So the question is merely how much cryolite
is needed to wet the alumina grains enough to form a solid mass.

I don’t know how hard or strong the resulting cryolite-cemented
alumina aggregate will be.

Lead-tin solder and type metal
------------------------------

[Lead][13] melts at 327°; [tin][14] melts at 232°; but 63% lead and
37% tin melts at 183°.  So you could flux lead filings with tin
filings, and then heat the piece to anywhere between 183° (or even a
bit less) and 327°.  [Lead costs about $2.20/kg; tin costs about
$22/kg][15].  So the mixture costs about US$10/kg, which is not
outrageous, but not cheap either. (You could probably reduce the price
further by reducing tin content, at the cost of a higher and less
crisp melting point.)

[13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead
[14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin
[15]: http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2012/5188/

However, lead is very dense (11.3g/cc), so a kilogram of this metal is
not very much, and the tin-lead alloy is very soft; you can nick it
with your fingernails.  Tin itself, at 7.4g/cc, is considerably less
dense.

Another problem with tin-lead solder is that it shrinks when it
solidifies, resulting in a rough surface.  [Type metal][20],
Gutenberg’s great invention, is a variant with a significant quantity
of antimony (US$6.60/kg, melts at 630°), which prevents this shrinkage
and improves hardness further.  The eutectic alloy is supposedly 84%
lead, 12% antimony, and 4% tin, which works out to US$3.50/kg; it
melts around 241°.  (The antimony-lead eutectic alloy melts at 252°.)

Type metal has a [Brinell hardness][22] of around 20, which is four
times that of lead, but one sixth that of soft steel.  This suggests
that its tensile strength might be .36 * 9.8 * 20 = 70 MPa, a little
better than PLA.

[22]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brinell_scale

Another possible alternative is pewter, which is tin fluxed with about
1% [copper][18] [(US$4.40/kg)][19] and 5% antimony.  This
is considerably harder than tin because of the alloying elements, and
I believe immune to tin pest, but it’s even more expensive.

Brass and bronze
----------------

Bronze (copper, which melts at 1084°, alloyed with about 12% tin;
bronze melts at about 950°) and brass (copper alloyed with around 40%
[zinc][17], US$2.20/kg; zinc melts at 420°, brass a bit past 900°) are
other possible alloys that could be shaped by this method.  Sprinkling
12% pricey tin filings into a copper bed to lower its melting point by
134° seems ideal.

[17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc

Using one metal as a binder for other metals, as in brazing
-----------------------------------------------------------

Brass is commonly used as a binder for other metals in brazing; you
could, for example, use a powder bed of iron filings and deposit brass
filings onto it before baking.  You could easily get most of the
strength and cost of the final piece from the iron filings.

The inexpensive metals — those less expensive than copper — are
aluminum (US$2.20/kg), arsenic (US$2.20/kg), iron (US$0.88/kg),
manganese (US$0.80/kg), silicon (US$2.40/kg), and zinc (US$2.20/kg);
and we should include carbon, since iron is commonly alloyed with
carbon (super cheap, depending on purity; [flake graphite costs
US$1.50/kg][25]) to make steel or cast iron.

Among these, zinc in particular (even without making brass by being
mixed with copper) seems like it would be a good choice as a binder
for an iron or steel filler, or possibly even for aluminum.  Zinc and
aluminum form a variety of useful alloys, and apparently there’s a
technique called “diffusion soldering” similar to this.  I’m not sure
what would be needed to remove the aluminum-oxide layer from the
surface of aluminum powder that has been exposed to air, though, and
both zinc powder and aluminum powder are a bit of a fire hazard.

Cast iron
---------

[Cast iron][27] melts around 1150° to 1200°, while pure iron melts at
1538°.  Steels have intermediate melting points; mild carbon steel is
the most common family, and [ASTM A36][28] is a typical mild carbon
steel; it has up to 0.29% carbon and 0.28% silicon, and according to
the [iron-carbon phase diagram][29], its melting point should still be
above 1500°.  Cast irons typically contain 1–3% silicon and 2–4%
carbon, although the eutectic point is at 4.3%.  At 3.5% carbon, the
melting point is reduced to 1200°.

[27]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron
[28]: http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6117
[29]: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Steel_pd.svg

So, you could take a bed of ASTM A36 filings and selectively flux them
with 3.25% carbon and 1% silicon, then heat them up to almost 1200°,
or maybe a bit more, but not past 1500°.  The part you’ve selectively
fluxed should sinter, and then you should be able to bake it more
thoroughly to make a more homogeneous cast-iron part; deformation from
the printed shape should be almost zero due to the silicon content
forcing carbon to remain in graphite form.

It might be a better idea to use a much smaller amount of carbon
and/or silicon, so that when the powder is heated, only a small part
of each filing around each carbon grain is melted, rather than the
entire filing; this way, the printed part will not liquefy completely,
and the finished part will be high-carbon steel rather than cast iron.

Tungsten carbide
----------------

[Tungsten carbide][23], one of the most important industrial ceramics,
can be made by reacting metallic [tungsten][24] with carbon at 1400°
to 2000°; it melts around 2800°, while tungsten melts at 3422° and
graphite sublimes at 3600°.  So you could “flux” a graphite powder bed
[(US$1.50/kg)][25] with powdered tungsten (US$200 per “short ton
unit”, which is 7.19 kg of tungsten, thus US$28/kg) and heat it up to
2000° or a bit less.

[23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten_carbide
[24]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten
[25]: http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/mcs-2014-graph.pdf

Alternatively, you could “flux” the graphite with [tungsten
trioxide][26], which melts at 1473°, and heat it only to 900° to react
it with the graphite and immediately produce the tungsten carbide.

[26]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten_trioxide

All of this might need to happen under pressure, I’m not sure.

Alpaca: raising the melting point instead of lowering it
--------------------------------------------------------

Here in Argentina, the common alternative to stainless steel or silver
used in silverware and whatnot is an alloy, invented by Qing China,
called “[alpaca][30]”, from the 19th-century brand name of a German
company; worldwide this is typically 60% copper, 20% [nickel][31]
(US$22/kg, melts at 1455°), and 20% zinc, working out to US$7.50/kg.
It looks like silver, it’s bactericidal like silver, and it’s strong
and easy to electroplate with, for example, silver.

The CRC Handbook of Mechanical Engineering gives the melting point of
the ASTM B122 formulation of alpaca in its quaint folk units of
measurement as 2030°F and its modulus of elasticity as 18 Mpsi, which
are 1110° and 124 GPa in SI.

Alpaca probably cannot be 3D-printed in the way discussed above,
because it melts at a higher temperature than copper, zinc, or alloys
thereof.  If you were to try selectively depositing copper and zinc
into a bed of powdered nickel, you would have the problem that the
product formed would be much larger than the powder it was deposited
into.

However, perhaps you could deposit powdered nickel into a bed of
powdered 75%-copper brass, and then heat it up to about 1000° or
1100°.  If the nickel has sufficiently diffused into the brass, the
brass will melt and run away, leaving a solid alpaca object coated and
perhaps permeated with liquid brass, as long as the nickel doesn’t
diffuse too far and become too dilute to prevent melting.  This
approach would eliminate the extra processing steps that commonly
attend powder-bed 3-D printers: the careful brushing of the powder
from the recesses of the solid part and extra processing steps to
eliminate porosity from the solid part.

This process may depend sensitively on grain sizes and morphologies
and on the temperature profile of the process.  It’s necessary for the
nickel to have diffused enough into the alpaca part to solidify it,
and for its grains to have sintered together enough to hold together,
before the unmodified brass becomes liquid; but if the nickel diffuses
too far, you will lose surface detail, as some brass outside the
desired part acquires enough nickel to keep it from melting, while
some of the alpaca inside the desired part loses enough nickel to
allow it to melt.

[30]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_silver
[31]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel

Using the alpaca approach for steel printing
--------------------------------------------

This approach should also work for printing carbon steel: by
increasing the carbon content of the unwanted part of the metal to the
eutectic 4.3%, it should become a low-viscosity liquid cast iron at a
sharp eutectic melting point of 1148°, permeating the pores of the
sintered higher-melting steel and contributing carbon to it.

Adding so much carbon is not quite as trivial as it sounds, because
the iron weighs 7.8 g/cc, while [carbon black][39] weighs only about 2
g/cc, and [graphite][40] about 2.2 g/cc.  So 4.3% carbon by weight is
about 15% carbon by volume, which is significant.  I think it should
still fit into the interstices of the iron filing bed if the carbon
particles are sufficiently smaller.

(And yes, this is an even bigger problem for alpaca.)
