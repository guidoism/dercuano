In the sci-fi user interface criticism blog [???] the guy complains
that it’s really bad user interface design for a HUD in a flying
machine to have things expand in place, because it triggers a human
“startle response”, which stresses people out, makes them blink, and
distracts them.

Presumably the underlying phenomenon here is that if something is
expanding rapidly in place in your visual field, it’s usually an
object flying rapidly at your face, which means it could hit you soon.

I was alarmed and concerned, because I’ve been playing a bit with
[ZUIs][0], and in ZUIs it’s really common for things to expand in
place.  I started thinking of workarounds: could we maybe zoom into a
thing by first zooming in on a point to the right of the screen, then
a point to the left of the screen, thus avoiding this response?

But does this visual "startle response" to zooming in exist at all?
If so, will it cause problems?  Or is the related “orienting response”
more relevant?  Here’s a cursory literature review.

Relevant literature
-------------------

[The Wikipedia article on "startle response"][15] says:

> In animals, including humans, the startle response is a largely
> unconscious defensive response to sudden or threatening stimuli,
> such as sudden noise or sharp movement, and is associated with
> negative affect.[1] Usually the onset of the startle response is a
> startle reflex reaction. The startle reflex is a brainstem
> reflectory reaction (reflex) that serves to protect vulnerable
> parts, such as the back of the neck (whole-body startle) and the
> eyes (eyeblink) and facilitates escape from sudden stimuli. It is
> found across the lifespan of many species.

[Startle and Surprise on the Flight Deck][1], Rivera et al., 2014.
This is a five-page paper on the difference between the “startle
reflex” and the “surprise emotion”.  It says that startle was “studied
extensively in the 1970s and 1980s”, but refers primarily to the
acoustic startle response, although it says, “The startle reflex can
be elicited through auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli,” citing
Carlsen et al. 2008, Davis et al. 1982, and Yeomans et al. 2002.  With
regard to effects we might care about in ZUIs, it says, “startle has
been found to impair information processing on mundane tasks,” and
“may induce brief disorientation and short-term psychomotor
impairments which are likely to lead to task interruptions, or brief
confusion,” and that “after startle”, “decision making can be
significantly impaired, especially higher-order functions”.

It does mention ways the startle response can be evoked visually:
sudden illumination of flight crews by lasers, for example.

[The "Startle Reflex" article in the Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum
Disorders][9], by Sterling, defines it as an “automatic response to
the sudden onset of an acoustic, visual, or tactile stimulus… that
varies systematically with the individual’s emotional state…
characterized by a fast series of muscle contractions around the head,
neck, and shoulders;” this says very little about what kind of stimuli
will cause it, other than “sudden”, or what kinds of cognitive effects
it might have.

[Human On-Line Response to Visual and Motor Target Expansion][3],
Cockburn and Brock 2005 or so, says that expanding mouse targets in
place as the mouse approaches them is “visually appealing” but also
“improves acquisition performance”.  Their main result is that it's
easier to click on things when they expand when you move the mouse
toward them, and that this is mostly due to the visual feedback, only
slightly due to the larger click target.  While this is basically not
about startling users at all, but rather about how long it takes to
click on things when they’re expanding (related to Fitts’ Law), it
provides a sort of useful negative evidence — in their experiments,
users were able to click on things faster when they expanded in place,
while if expanding stuff in place was invoking a strong “startle
reflex”, you’d expect to see their performance worsen.  But maybe they
didn’t expand fast enough or far enough, or maybe the performance
improvement would have been even greater without the “startle
response” confounding it.

[The Wikipedia article on “fear-potentiated startle”][5] mentions
bright light as a stimulus that elicits “startle”, and says that the
“startle” is stronger when the organism is afraid, or when the person
is traumatized or not depressed, and mentions some symptoms of
“startle”: blinking and faster pulse.  However, apparently, usually
the experiments use loud noises.

[The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation][11], by Tinwell, p.106,
section “Lack of Visual Startle Reflex and Psychopathy,” says that we
make surprised faces when “we experience a sight or sound that
frightens or surprises us”, except for psychopaths.  It’s talking
about things like “seeing a shadow when we thought we were alone,”
though, not seeing windows expand on a screen, and it doesn’t mention
cognitive effects.  The author is bringing this up because apparently
people who act scared or surprised without showing fear “in the upper
facial region” are creepy (“uncanny”) and that maybe this is a reason
animations can be creepy.

[Boo! Culture, Experience, and the Startle Reflex][12], by Simons,
1996, is a 288-page book about the “startle reflex”.  It goes into
quite a bit of philosophizing about the relationships between culture,
biology, and psychology, saying things like, “Being startled changes…
one's relationship with the entire experienced universe,” and
“Pythagoras… showed that the soul is mathematical.”

The author is a collaborator of Ekman and Friesen who himself did
original research on startle some years back, using pistol sounds.

It explains, “The subject of the book is a more general one: (1) How
one's experience of being in the world is shaped by neurophysiology
and how it is shaped by prior experience, beliefs, values, and social
condition, and (2) how these different types of shaping influences
might be consid- ered jointly in single explanatory formulations.”

It gives some more detail on what the startle response *is*, exactly
(p. 9):

>  The usual human startle response is precisely the set of behaviors
>  that would be maximally effective in minimizing the chance of a
>  fatal encounter. The response includes both physical events and
>  alterations in attention, thought, and mood. Instantaneously and
>  without reflection, forward motion is checked. The raised foot is
>  arrested or drawn back and the upper limbs are drawn in to
>  safety. Visual attention is locked onto the eliciting stimulus,
>  whatever had been in consciousness is obliterated, and the mind is
>  filled with one thought: “Snake!” Startling stimuli other than
>  snakes elicit similar immediate patterned rapid-avoidance behaviors
>  and similar redirection of attention.

In the context of ZUIs, redirecting your attention to what you’re
zooming into might be *good*, and that would be consonant with the
positive results Cockburn and Brock got from inflating click targets.

He confirms the 14-ms number Sourakov (the butterfly dude) cites for
human startle response time, but for tightening jaw muscles, not
blinking.

He cites “Hoffman, 1984, p.275”, which turns out to be “Methodological
factors in the behavioral analysis of startle,” as a paper that
mentions a “startling sight.”  His Table 1.2 on p.14 lists startling
stimuli; the visual items include “dangerous or appalling sights”
(“snakes and creepy-crawlies, other dangers, appalling sights”),
“bright lights”, “sudden motion”, “great beauty”, and “cessation of a
stimulus”.  Later (p.21), he reports on visual stimuli that startled
his informant Barbara Haldane:

>  I mentioned before my startle reaction to the sight of a large
>  spider (or a picture or drawing of one); other large images of
>  things with spindly legs, such as ants and other insects, produce a
>  similar but less-violent startle reaction.
>
>  A real snake (but not a picture of one)…
> 
>  As I told you, the unexpected sight of a human skull--of nearly
>  life-sized or larger proportions, anyway--induces a shock in me
>  ... especially if it has dark eye-sockets.
> 
>  The sight of a larger-than-life human face looking directly at me
>  (at the camera, in the case of a photo) has a similar shock
>  value. I recall one instance of being quite unpleasantly startled
>  by the face of Sophia Loren on a magazine cover, and more than once
>  by an ad in a magazine featuring eyes (larger than life) looking
>  directly at the viewer. (Both eyes usually have to be present — one
>  big eye doesn't have as much effect.) [T]hese reactions are invol-
>  untary and uncontrollable unless the sight in question is antici-
>  pated, and even then I am apt to experience an internal moment of
>  panic.

And his hyperstartler informant Gould startles easily with a variety
of visual stimuli, including boys jumping out at her at a ranch, her
children stepping out into the hall in front of her, a classroom of
her students having turned their desks around while she wasn’t paying
attention, and putting on the wrong kind of glasses.

The exaggerated startle reaction he reports of Gould, in which she
screams for a while, falls to her knees, and throws whatever she’s
holding, would certainly be a UX problem in a ZUI; it would likely
break her phone.  However, it seems to be mostly related to seeing
unexpected things, not to a lower-level stimulus such as a thing
expanding in her field of vision, regardless of whether it’s expected
or not.

[Visual Pathways Involved in Fear Conditioning Measured with
Fear-Potentiated Startle: Behavioral and Anatomic Studies][2], Shi and
Davis 2001, startled rats with sounds or electric shocks but
*conditioned* them to associate the “startle response” with visual
stimuli.  Then they injected different drugs into different parts of
the rats’ brains to see which parts were involved in the association.
This paper doesn’t use an innate visual startle response or human
subjects, so it is of no interest.

[The pupil as a measure of emotional arousal and autonomic
activation][4], Bradley et al. 2013 had people look at pleasant or
unpleasant pictures, measuring their emotional response to the
pictures by their pupil diameter, skin conductance, and pulse.  They
also found that people’s pupils contracted even more when the pictures
were bright than when they were unpleasant. This came up because they
startled some people, but not others, with loud noises before showing
the pictures.  However, they didn’t report on the results of this part
of the experiment in the paper!

backwards.  Their results were that people who blinked more also
cringed further backwards.

startling the subjects with loud noises as a way to measure the
emotional effect of looking at pleasant or unpleasant pictures or
being told they would be electrically shocked.  Their results are
somewhat involved and they draw a bunch of conclusions about the role
of the amygdala in fear that I don’t care about.

[Extraordinarily Quick Visual Startle Reflexes of Skipper Butterflies
(Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) are Among the Fastest Recorded in the
Animal Kingdom][13], by Sourakov, 2009, is about visual startle
reflexes in butterflies.  I think butterfly eyes and visual cortices
evolved separately from our own, so I doubt that conclusions about
startle reflexes in butterflies are applicable to humans.  It does,
however, mention that loud noises can make people blink within 14 ms,
puffs of air can make us blink within 30–50 ms, but these butterflies
jump into the air in less than the researcher’s camera’s exposure time
of 17 ms when visually startled by the flash; however, it claims that
this is “twice as fast as the fastest startle reflex of humans”, so, I
don’t even know.
