I have a lot of stuff I want to make prototypes of that I haven’t
gotten around to yet.

1. A compiler for a comfortable programming language.  Emitting
   relatively naïve native code, like within a factor of 5 of native
   code, should be pretty easy.  Ur-Scheme did it.  But something with
   structs, iterators (maybe downward funarg blocks?) and maybe some
   escape analysis or something would be better.  And for OO stuff,
   Piumarta’s tiny MOP seems like it should be able to deliver dynamic
   dispatch performance within a small factor of a regular function
   call.

2. A deterministic virtual machine.  This is closely tied to the
   previous one.

3. Some fucking laser-cut furniture.

4. A video game that’s fun to play.  Maybe tie in with information
   archival somehow.

5. Executable models of electromagnetic and mechanical engineering
   phenomena.

6. Some kind of live-within live programming environment, like Emacs,
   Smalltalk, and actually sort of Unix.

7. Something that does something interesting with machine vision.

8. An optimization system that’s applicable to laser-cut designs,
   using executable models of mechanical engineering phenomena.

9. A solar heating and dehumidifying system.

10. A system for drawing process flow diagrams.

11. A ZUI.  Another one, one with text and server-side persistence.

12. A usable time-series database, unless someone else has written one
    by now.
