What’s the hipster stack in 2017?  Or, maybe, what’s the most
powerful, highest-leverage software tool stack available?  Here are my
notes on trying to learn it.

Overview of the current hipster trends
--------------------------------------

I’m not totally sure, but I’m thinking that it’s probably something
like React (with JSX) for the frontend (with maybe Less or something
for the CSS), Node for the server (with nginx in front of it), and
SQLite for the database, though there seems to be a lot of
fragmentation here, with lots of people using MariaDB, Redis, MongoDB,
or whatever the hell.  For administering the server, we use Docker
(probably on Ubuntu) and Puppet and Kubernetes, and for an editor, we
use Atom.  When we’re not using Docker, we virtualize our testing
environment with Vagrant in VirtualBox.  And we chat about it all on
Slack.

### StackOverflow trends ###

<http://stackoverflow.com/tags?tab=popular> has JS as the top language
tag (followed by Java, C#, and PHP); Android as the top platform tag
(followed by iOS); MySQL as the top database tag (followed by SQL and
sql-server); etc.  I did a SQL query to see what the current ones were
at
<https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/664354/most-popular-stackoverflow-tags-in-2017>
and got JS (followed by Java, Python, and PHP); Android (followed by
iOS); jQuery as the top JS framework (followed by Angular, twice, and
then React); MySQL as the top database (followed by SQL and
sql-server); Excel as the most popular IDE (followed by XCode, Visual
Studio, Android Studio, Matlab, and Eclipse); the top UI toolkit is
HTML (followed by jQuery, CSS, Angular, and finally WPF at #60 and Qt
at #96); etc.  Firebase, Typescript, Pandas, Swift, AWS, Azure,
Android Studio, and Spark also seem to be hot compared to previously.
<https://data.stackexchange.com/serverfault/query/664369/most-popular-serverfault-tags-in-2017>
is the same query on ServerFault, from which we learn that nginx and
AWS are hot.

The relatively most fashionable things this year are centos7, docker,
apache-2.4, azure, windows-server-2012-r2, linux-networking,
amazon-web-services, php-fpm, and reverse-proxy, each of which had
more than twice the proportion of all stackoverflow tags this year as
over the life of stackoverflow.  However, nginx is far more popular
than Apache now!  And AWS is still more popular than Azure, and Ubuntu
still more popular than CentOS.

### Hacker News trends ###

The fashionable things on Hacker News seem to be, at the moment:

* Machine learning: 2 items on front page, 1 item in 30 newest, 2
  comments in 30 newest
* Linux: 4 comments in 30 newest
* Computer vision: 1 item on front page, 2 comments in 30 newest
* Rust: 1 item on front page, 2 comments in 30 newest
* Python 3: 1 item on front page, 1 comment in 30 newest
* C++: 1 item on front page, 1 comment in 30 newest
* React: 2 items in 30 newest
* C: 2 comments in 30 newest
* Docker and similar containers: 1 item on front page
* Kubernetes: 1 item on front page
* Redis: 1 item on front page
* TypeScript: 1 item on front page
* Dataflow programming (Fathom, in this case): 1 item on front page
* Rails: 1 item in 30 newest
* Golang: 1 comment in 30 newest

I mean that’s super crude.  Note how different it is from the
StackOverflow list!

### Github trends ###

GitHub has [a list of language implementations developed there][0].
Swift has 38k stars and 5k forks; Golang has 27k stars and 3k forks;
Rust has 21k stars and 4k forks; TypeScript has 21k stars and 3k
forks; CoffeeScript still has 13k stars and 1k forks; Ruby has 12k
stars and 3k forks; and PHP has 11k stars and 3k forks.  Of course,
this excludes languages whose implementation isn’t GitHub-hosted and
those with many implementations, like C++.

[0]: https://github.com/showcases/programming-languages

Similarly, they have [a list of NoSQL databases hosted there][1],
leading with Redis, RethinkDB, and MongoDB.  Redis is actually more
than twice as popular as Mongo.  RethinkDB is probably dead.  Their
[list of trending repositories this year][2] includes Mastodon, which
is built on Rails, Docker, Vagrant, Nginx, Redis, Postgres, and Node;
a guide to learning bash; an IDE for React, React itself, react-bits
(tips), and react-sketchapp; a repo of minimal examples of algorithms
in Python; TensorFlow, a TensorFlow-based NN library, and Caffe; a
medium.com clone built on React, Angular, Node, and Django (?); a
Sendgrid clone built on Rails, MySQL, RabbitMQ (!), and Node called
Postman; Vue.js; Atlassian’s LocalStack, an AWS clone; a list of hot Mac
apps (headed by Atom), and at #1, a “roadmap”.

### The Roadmap ###

[The roadmap][3] recommends learning, for a frontend developer, HTML,
CSS, JS, ES6, npm scripts, Gulp for running tasks, Yarn, npm,
TypeScript, some JS test framework (Jest or Mocha), webpack,
Bootstrap, Sass, and some JS framework (Angular, React (in which case
either Flux or Redux), or Vue.js); or, for a backend developer, one of
Python, PHP, Node, Ruby, C#, Java, or Golang.  For Python, they
recommend pip, unittest, Django, and aiohttp (which is apparently an
async/await thing built on Python 3’s new (2013) asyncio library); for
Node, they recommend npm, Yarn, Express, and Mocha.  For going deeper
on the backend, they recommend nginx, RESTful APIs, reading about MVC,
authentication with OAuth 2.0 and JWT (JSON Web Token),
“SOLID/YAGNI/KISS etc.”  (i.e. learning how to program), regexps,
security, and Docker; deeper still, they recommend memcached and Redis
for caching, Postgres, MariaDB, and MySQL as relational databases, and
Redis and MongoDB as nonrelational databases.  To “up your game
further”, they suggest search engines (ideally ElasticSearch), GoF
design patterns, architectural patterns, “give DDD a shot”, and “learn
different testing techniques”.

There’s an entirely separate roadmap for devops, recommending either
Linux or Unix, AWS, automation (either CloudFormation, Puppet,
Ansible, or Terraform), CI/CD (Jenkins, Travis, or TeamCity),
monitoring and alerting (Nagios, PagerDuty, or AppDynamics), Docker
(or maybe rkt), Apache and nginx, cluster managers (Kubernetes,
Mesosphere, Mesos, Docker Swarm, or Nomad), loving the terminal,
vim/nano, bash scripts, compiling apps from source, and a tree of
commands:

text: awk sed grep sort uniq cat cut echo fmt tr nl egrep fgrep wc  
ps: ps top htop atop  
perf: nmon iostat sar vmstat  
net: nmap tcpdump ping traceroute airmon airodump

Then there’s a set of other things you should know: the OSI model
(oddly subtitled TCP/IP/UDP), knowledge about different filesystems,
setting up a reverse proxy, setting up a caching server, setting up a
load balancer (HAProxy or nginx), setting up a firewall, TLS,
STARTTLS, SSL, HTTPS, SSH, SCP, SFTP, and “postmortem analysis when
something bad happens”.

[3]: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap

It seems like most people are using Macs on the desktop and Linux on
the server.

### Proggit ###

On Proggit, the [top few items][6] are mostly the same as on HN (last
night), but not quite the same.  Trendy topics include computer
vision, machine learning, D, security (which is everywhere even though
I haven’t mentioned it previously), Docker and containerization,
Clojure, Postman (the Sendgrid clone I mentioned above), a .NET thing
called “Entity Framework”, NixOS, Git, XAML, Heroku, AWS, Vue.js, vim,
TLS, Python, Racket, AI, interviewing, Unicode, Spotify, Postgres,
Rails, and OpenGL GLSL.

Leverage
--------

The things that are fashionable are not necessarily the things that
provide the most leverage.  SQLite is a *lot* faster than MySQL, not
to mention a lot easier to install and administer, for what it does.
Java and Rust are a lot lower leverage for most things than Python or,
often, PHP.

Slightly more in-depth overview of the top hipster technologies
---------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s my subjective perception of the top 32 hipster technologies for
2017, some of which are actually old.  Here’s a paragraph about where
each one seems to be in 2017:

1. JS
2. CSS
3. nginx
4. Firebase
5. Angular
6. Slack
7. Reactive and dataflow programming
8. Node.js
9. Mobile-friendly web design
10. Python
11. Less
12. MySQL and MariaDB
13. Neural networks and other machine learning
14. Android
15. TensorFlow
16. Golang
17. Docker
18. Linux (Ubuntu and systemd)
19. Mocha (the testing framework)
20. Bootstrap
21. TLS/SSL
22. AWS
23. RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ
24. TypeScript
25. Redis
26. Atom
27. Swift
28. JSON
29. SQLite
30. Chef
31. Rust
32. React

As a bonus, I’m adding:

33. Jenkins

JavaScript is by far the dominant programming language, with
performance close to that of C, but garbage collection and a flexible
object model like Python or Smalltalk.  A lot of server-side
development is still being done in C++ (which still runs faster) or
Golang, or still being done in Python (which is still more flexible
and easier to read), but the gap seems to be closing rapidly, as more
and more is done in Node.js.  In web browsers, JS is still the only
real runtime option, although WebAssembly is working to open the
browser to a wider range of languages, and TypeScript is gaining
popularity as a statically typed and therefore more maintainable
version of JS.  ECMAScript 6 is now broadly implemented, and its
features seem like they close most of the usability gap that used to
exist between JS and more ergonomic languages like Python.

CSS has accidentally become Turing-complete recently and may become
sentient soon.  Most people use preprocessors like Sass (or Less).
There are [conferences devoted entirely to CSS][9].  But there still
isn’t a browser that supports both hyphenation and widow-and-orphan
control for printing.  Not satisfied with the original CSS box model
and its variants, they have now stuffed three entirely separate layout
models into CSS: standard, flexbox, and [grid][10].  CSS transforms
allow pretty trippy (GPU-accelerated!)  effects now.  Also apparently
CSS animation is a thing now.

[10]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout

Nginx is event-based, shuffling any kind of multiprocess management
off to some backend process, communicating either via FastCGI (or
SCGI, or uWSGI for Python) or via HTTP (acting as a reverse proxy).
This supports WebSockets a lot better than Apache’s preforking MPM
can, and it’s the sensible way to structure things if you’re using
microservices.  It’s also a lot simpler to configure than Apache.  A
minimal install is about 350k.  In addition to HTTP (and SPDY and
HTTP/2), it speaks IMAP, SMTP, and POP3.  Hot topics seem to be load
balancing, microservices, HTTP/2, and security.

Google Firebase is billed as a “real-time database”, but it’s really a
web API.  It seems to be something like Meteor or KnowNow, but done
right.  It replicates (JSON) data on all devices, supporting offline
operation, and sends asynchronous update notifications whenever it
changes.  It even supports iOS.

Google Angular is a client-side in-browser JS app framework, like
jQuery, Backbone, Knockout, Ember, Sencha, and other such forgotten
relics.  It uses npm to install, Node to run a development server, and
preferably Microsoft TypeScript for your code.  It has two-way data
binding for doing easy CRUD database screens and, more generally,
declarative update propagation with an extensible HTML template
language.  It’s an alternative to React, and Angular is slightly more
popular, with 48k question on SO, compared to React’s 40k; [people
like React better][12], but [apparently React is gaining ground][13].

Slack is a centralized SaaS alternative to IRC.  (Free clones include
Mattermost and Rocket.chat.)  It takes seven seconds to switch
channels in current Firefox on a modern four-core 1.6GHz machine that
isn’t trying to swap.  The chat lines are editable, replyable, and
written in a pidgin plaintext markup language derived from Markdown.
It provides link previews for some links.

Both React and Angular are manifestations of reactive programming, and
many forms of dataflow programming are also being bruited about.
Angular is built on a more basic reactive framework called Rx.js.
Spark is a popular dataflow programming system for big data.  Dataflow
has its roots in a forgotten language from the 1970s called Lucid,
whose open-source implementation plucid is on GitHub.

The main stream of MySQL development is now MariaDB, and despite the
continuing fallout from the Oracle acquisition, MySQL is still
dramatically more popular than SQLite and PostgreSQL (the two main
alternatives) combined.  [Uber switched from Postgres to MySQL
recently][7] and [the MySQL tag on StackOverflow has 25000 questions
so far in 2017][8] compared to 12000 for Microsoft SQL Server, 7000
for Firebase, 5000 for Postgres, and almost 2900 for SQLite.

Node vs. LinuxMint
------------------

I installed a current Linux Mint (version “Sarah”) on this laptop last
year.  Apparently, though, the current version of Node is 7.9.0 and
the current LTS version is 6.10.2, but Linux Mint ships with Node
4.2.6!  That version difference makes it sound enormously old, but
actually [it came out 2016-01-21.][5] As the changelog says, “Node.js
v4 is covered by the Node.js Long Term Support Plan and will be
supported actively until April 2017 and maintained until April 2018.”

[5]: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V4.md#4.2.6

Node and SQLite3
----------------

Nevertheless, I was able to `npm install sqlite3`.

<https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API> is the documentation
for what seems to be the most popular SQLite binding for Node.  It’s
super easy to use although it seems to handle errors by killing the
Node CLI process sometimes:

    (new (require('sqlite3').Database)('test.db'))
         .run("create table x (y varchar)")
         .run("insert into x (y) values ('qqq')")
         .each("select * from x", (err, row) => console.log([err, row]))
    Database { open: false, filename: 'test.db', mode: 65542 }
    > events.js:141
          throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
          ^

    Error: SQLITE_ERROR: table x already exists
        at Error (native)
    $

If you give it an error callback, that doesn’t happen:

    > tdb.run("create table x (y varchar)", err => console.log(err))
    Database { open: true, filename: 'test.db', mode: 65542 }
    > { [Error: SQLITE_ERROR: table x already exists] errno: 1, code: 'SQLITE_ERROR' }

The `select` does work:

    > new sqlite3.Database('test.db').each("select * from x", (err, row) => console.log([err, row]))
    Database { open: false, filename: 'test.db', mode: 65542 }
    > [ null, { y: 'qqq' } ]

So all the deliciousness of SQLite is easily available from Node,
albeit without the modern promise interface.

npm
---

For some reason `npm` started breaking on me when I was trying to
`install mocha` inside the `sqlite3` directory; I consulted the debug
log and the offending line was this one, in filter-invalid-actions.js:

    if (pkg.isInLink || pkg.parent.target || pkg.parent.isLink) {

I changed it to this:

    if (pkg.isInLink || pkg.parent && (pkg.parent.target || pkg.parent.isLink)) {

But that didn't really help.  What helped was not being inside the
`sqlite3` directory.  But then `npm test` still didn’t work, because
it was looking for a directory `test` under `sqlite3` that doesn’t
exist.

npm is [notorious for installing tens of thousands of files][11] in
projects that use it, such as Angular.

[11]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38718690/huge-number-of-files-generated-for-every-angular-project

ES6
---

Firefox and Chrome both support a lot of ES6 features, as of course
does Node, and you can compile to older JS versions if you want to
support old, unpatched iPhones or whatever (although none of the
compilers-to-JS have ES6 support as comprehensive as Firefox or
Chrome).  And ES6 fixes most of the problems that used to make JS a
pain in the ass, making it (probably?) actually a better language than
Python instead of a worse one.

I’m not totally sure it is going to be better, because some of the
changes might result in previously invalid code that was actually a
mistake now getting DWIMmed in some unexpected way.  But I am
optimistic.

There’s [a compatibility table][4] that shows which features work
where.

[4]: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

I’m going to list the features that seem most interesting to me, which
unfortunately are mostly not very flashy:

### `let` ###

Everywhere you could use `var` you can now use `let` or `const` to get
a block-scoped variable, avoiding in some cases the need for IIFEs.

    > function mr(n) { let rv=[]; for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { let j=i; rv.push(function() { return j; }); } return rv; }
    undefined
    > mr(5)
    [ [Function], [Function], [Function], [Function], [Function] ]
    > mr(5)[2]()
    2

(Node’s REPL kind of sucks for multiline statements because of the way
its history works, in exactly the same way that Python’s does, but in
JS you actually can get away with glomming everything onto one line.)

This contrasts with the traditional behavior:

    > function mr(n) { let rv=[]; for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) { let j=i; rv.push(function() { return i; }); } return rv; }
    undefined
    > mr(5)[3]()
    5

However, this also works, and I have no idea how:

    > function mr(n) { let rv=[]; for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { let j=i; rv.push(function() { return i; }); } return rv; }
    undefined
    > mr(5)[2]()
    2

### for...of loops, generators, and the iteration protocol ###

This is a big improvement for what I think are the most common kinds
of loops:

    > for (let x of [42, 33, 5353]) console.log(x)
    42
    33
    5353
    undefined

That is, it does what you probably thought `for x in` would do when
you first learned JS.  But wait!  There’s more!  You can use it on
arbitrary things that implement the iteration protocol, including
Python-style generator functions:

    > function* things() { yield 42; yield 33; yield 5353; }
    undefined
    > for (let x of things()) console.log(x)
    42
    33
    5353
    undefined
    > t = things()
    {}
    > t.next()
    { value: 42, done: false }
    > t.next()
    { value: 33, done: false }
    > t.next()
    { value: 5353, done: false }
    > t.next()
    { value: undefined, done: true }

The extra `*` disambiguates syntactically.

It’s possible to write your own objects that implement this same
iterable protocol, but it’s kind of a pain in the ass:

    > cd = { [Symbol.iterator]: function() { return { n: 5, next: function() { if (this.n) return {value: this.n--}; else return {done: true}; } } } };
    {}
    > for (let x of cd) console.log(x)
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    undefined

In the terminology of MDN and I guess ECMA-262, `cd` above is an
“iterable”, and the generator returned from `things` is evidently an
“iterator.”  Unlike in Python, iterators are not required to be
iterables, but apparently `for...of` handles that case okay.  But it
does not work to pass the iterator derived from `cd` to `for...of`:

    > for (let x of cd[Symbol.iterator]()) console.log(x)
    TypeError: cd[Symbol.iterator] is not a function
        at repl:1:56
        at REPLServer.defaultEval (repl.js:252:27)
        at bound (domain.js:287:14)
        at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (domain.js:300:12)
        at REPLServer.<anonymous> (repl.js:417:12)
        at emitOne (events.js:82:20)
        at REPLServer.emit (events.js:169:7)
        at REPLServer.Interface._onLine (readline.js:210:10)
        at REPLServer.Interface._line (readline.js:549:8)
        at REPLServer.Interface._ttyWrite (readline.js:826:14)
    > ci = cd[Symbol.iterator]
    [Function]
    > for (let x of ci) console.log(x)
    TypeError: undefined is not a function
        at repl:1:37
        at REPLServer.defaultEval (repl.js:252:27)
        at bound (domain.js:287:14)
        at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (domain.js:300:12)
        at REPLServer.<anonymous> (repl.js:417:12)
        at emitOne (events.js:82:20)
        at REPLServer.emit (events.js:169:7)
        at REPLServer.Interface._onLine (readline.js:210:10)
        at REPLServer.Interface._line (readline.js:549:8)
        at REPLServer.Interface._ttyWrite (readline.js:826:14)

Also those error messages are super confusing, which I guess is one
way JS has always been worse than Python.

Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a library comparable to Python
itertools in the standard, but the things you would expect to be able
to do do work:

    > function* ifilter(predicate, items) { for (let item of items) if (predicate(item)) yield item; }
    undefined
    > function* irange(end) { let n = 0; while (n<end) yield n++; }
    undefined
    > ifilter(function(x) { let q = Math.sqrt(x); return q === Math.floor(q); }, irange(10))
    {}
    > Array.from(ifilter(function(x) { let q = Math.sqrt(x); return q === Math.floor(q); }, irange(10)))
    [ 0, 1, 4, 9 ]

I’m not sure how to deal with the weird iterator/iterable protocol
nonconformance thing for algorithms like merge, though.  MDN says it
should not be so.

### λ syntax: “arrow functions” `(a, b) => a + b` ###

JS’s traditional lambda-expression syntax that I’ve been using above
has always been terribly unwieldy, and it also has always had a
binding problem with `this`.  So they adopted a shorter syntax and
made it lexically bind `this`.  Using the `irange` generator above,
here’s a more efficient way to lazily generate a stream of squares:

    > function* imap(f, xs) { for (let x of xs) yield(f(x)) }
    undefined
    > Array.from(imap(x => x*x, irange(10)))
    [ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 ]

This `x => x*x` compares favorably to Smalltalk's `[:x | x * x ]`,
although it’s the best case; in cases where you need other numbers of
arguments, you need parens (e.g. `() => x*x` or `(x, y) => x*y`), and
in cases where you have multiple statements, you need curly braces and
likely a `return` statement; so, for example, it doesn’t buy you that
much here:

    > Array.from(ifilter(x => { let q = Math.sqrt(x); return q === Math.floor(q) }, irange(10)))
    [ 0, 1, 4, 9 ]

Firefox, CoffeeScript, and some versions of Traceur and BabelJS had
implemented array comprehensions, which would have been a better
alternative for many cases, but since they didn’t get in (they were
removed in ES6 draft 27 in August 2014), higher-order methods and the
arrow syntax are as good as it gets.  Here’s what it array
comprehensions look like in Firefox:

    » [for (x of [3, 4, 11, 22]) if (x % 2 === 0) x*x]
    ← Array [ 16, 484 ]

This is considerably better than Python’s inside-out syntax.

### `...`: spread and rest ###

This isn’t supported in Node 4.2.6, unfortunately.  Neither is
destructuring assignment.

Object constructor shorthand is in there, so you can say `return
{x,y}` and you can say `let x = { y() { return 43; } };`.

### Performance ###

Node is a lot faster than Python at raw computation.  Here’s a very
simple test that gives the crudest outlines of the degree of
improvement; in it, Node is about half as fast as C, but three times
as fast as PyPy and 20 times as fast as CPython or Jython.

We can define the standard naïve Fibonacci benchmark in ES6 as
follows:

    > fib = n => n < 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

This takes time proportional to its return value.

    user@debian ~ $ time node -e 'fib = n => n < 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); console.log(fib(3))'
    3

    real	0m0.161s
    user	0m0.132s
    sys	0m0.024s
    user@debian ~ $ time node -e 'fib = n => n < 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); console.log(fib(42))'
    433494437

    real	0m11.056s
    user	0m11.028s
    sys	0m0.020s

That’s crudely about 40 million units per second, according to (/
433494437 (- 11.056 .161)).  Doing the same test in CPython would be
annoyingly slow, but here’s a similar one:

    user@debian ~ $ time python -c 'fib = lambda n: 1 if n < 2 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); print fib(3)'

(/ 14930352 (- 8.338 .046)) gives us about 1.8 million units per
second, about 20 times slower.

Jython is in the same speed class, perhaps slightly faster:

    user@debian ~ $ time jython -c 'fib = lambda n: 1 if n < 2 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); print fib(35)'
    "my" variable $jythonHome masks earlier declaration in same scope at /usr/bin/jython line 15.

PyPy is better, only about three times as slow as Node:

    user@debian ~ $ time pypy -c 'fib = lambda n: 1 if n < 2 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); print fib(3)'

As a sort of gold performance standard for this machine, here’s a C
implementation of the same dumb algorithm, which, compiled with `gcc
-O`, is more than twice as fast as Node:

    user@debian ~/dev3 $ cat fib.c
    fib(n) { return n < 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); }
    main(int c, char **v) { printf("%d\n", fib(atoi(v[1]))); }
    user@debian ~/dev3 $ time ./fib 35
    14930352

    real	0m0.186s
    user	0m0.180s
    sys	0m0.004s
    user@debian ~/dev3 $ time ./fib 42
    433494437

    real	0m5.073s
    user	0m5.064s
    sys	0m0.000s

So this is a lot of extra leverage.  If you write an algorithm in a
straightforward way in Node, you can expect it to run about as fast as
if you write it in a vectorized way using Numpy, or twenty times as
fast as if you write it in a straightforward way in CPython.

Nginx
-----

Nginx (2600 SO questions in 2017) is now almost as popular as Apache
(4400 questions in 2017), but while Apache’s share of questions is
unchanged, Nginx’s share of questions in 2017 is double its overall
share of questions, indicating that its usage is trending sharply
upward.

Slack
-----

Aside from how to *use* Slack effectively for chatting, there’s the
question of how to build things on it.

IndieWebCamp has written [a bit about how their link preview or
“unfurling” works][14], and [Slack themselves have explained in
detail][15].  Basically they use OpenGraph, which [IndieWebCamp have
also documented][16].
