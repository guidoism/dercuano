I have several notes on window systems:

File `cached-soa-desktop` is about a REST architecture applied to a
windowing system, with each 16×16 tile being a separate resource,
using a cache invalidation protocol for redraws.

File `bubbleos` talks briefly about Wercam, a secure windowing system.

File `futuristic-os` talks about what I think a “cool” or “futuristic”
OS should look like, or rather what “outdated” OSes look like.

File `minimal-window-system` talks about how to make a windowing
system use a minimal amount of code, considering different design
alternatives.

File `pixel-stream` talks about a protocol for windowing systems.

File `real-time-windowing` asks about how to make windowing systems
guaranteed responsive.
