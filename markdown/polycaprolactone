ShapeLock is actually polycaprolactone, I think, an extremely
shatterproof biodegradable, bioimplantable, anti-static (? or is that
only Mater-Bi?) thermoplastic with a melting point around 60°C
and a relatively low price.  It’s weak, though, and quite viscous when
melted.

Tradenames are Mater-BiZ (a mixture of polycaprolactone and starch),
Anderson Andur 6 APLM, Boltaron 4300, and Dow Tone P-767 or P-787.
See <http://www.ides.com/grades/Boltaron_grades.htm> and related
pages.

There is some pricing in the RepRap blog comments:
<http://blog.reprap.org/2005/12/polymorph-and-polycaprolactone.html>
says “$5.30-3.50/lb for CAPA 6800”.  It also gives the name “CAPA 6800
polycaprolactone (2-Oxepanone, homopolymer; molecular weight 80,000,
CAS number: 24980-41-4)”.

The blog post suggests [Solvay Interox
Ltd.](http://www.solvaycaprolactones.com/) as a supplier.  In early
2008, they were sold to the Perstorp Group of Sweden.  CAPA was
Solvay’s brand.  Now it is <http://www.perstorpcaprolactones.com/>;
they claim to be a “global supplier”.

<http://reprap.org/bin/view/Main/Polymorph> says Solvay’s product cost
US$9/kg in 20kg or 500kg bags.

By comparison, [Forrest Higgs
says](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,2083 "message in the ‘Whens
RepRap likely to take off?’ thread on the RepRap forums on 2007-05-29”):

There’s another blog post on the topic at
<http://createdigitalmusic.com/2006/08/29/prototyping-custom-gear-friendly-plastic-aka-shapelock/>
that says it’s hard to find the stuff in Australia.

Someone suggested [Consilium
Designs](http://stores.ebay.com/Consilium-Designs-Ltd), an eBay
merchant that sells many specialty substances.
<http://www.mutr.co.uk/> is another UK company that carries
essentially the same items.

According to Perstorp’s datasheet, their product crystallizes at 25°C,
has a glass transition temperature at 60°C, and has 77 joules per gram
heat of fusion, more or less.  And it supercools.  Yield stress is
around 16±1MPa, modulus is around 470±30MPa, and strain at break is >700%.

When melted, the higher molecular weight polycaprolactones are 4x as
viscous as the lower molecular weight ones, but they all decrease in
viscosity by another factor of 6 or so when heated to 150°C.

It’s very permeable to CO₂, water, and oxygen.

One person reported that polycaprolactone is better than HDPE for FDM
accuracy at great length; it warps less, has less “die swell” (that
is, the molten filament isn’t much bigger than the extruding hole),
sticks to more things, and is “more compliant” (??).  But it has a lot
of other problems.
