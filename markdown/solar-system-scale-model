Suppose you wanted to build a scale model of the solar system at
manageable scale.  For example, 5 meters in diameter.

You probably have to include at least out to Neptune.  The Oort Cloud
maybe isnâ€™t really necessary.  But omitting Neptune would be
unreasonable.  Neptune orbits at 30.1 AUs, and if your model only has
one side of the solar system, then you could make 30.1 AUs correspond
to 5 meters.

30.1 AUs is 4.5e12 meters, so the scale of the model is about 1e12:1.
At this scale:

- Sun diameter: 1.4e9 meters becomes 1.4 mm (visible with the naked
  eye!)
- Earth diameter: 13e6 meters becomes 13 microns (will require a
  microscope)
- Earth orbital radius: 150e9 meters becomes 150 mm
- Jupiter diameter: 140e6 meters becomes 140 microns (visible with the
  naked eye, barely, but with a microscope you should be able to see
  the Great Red Spot)
- Jupiter orbital radius: 5.2 AU, 780e9 meters becomes 780 mm
- Neptune diameter: 25e6 meters becomes 25 microns (pretty much still
  requires a microscope)

It would be super awesome if you could continuously maintain a carbon
arc or something similarly bright at the position of the Sun, so that
you could see what the Sun looks like from different distances.  This
might be kind of dangerous though.
