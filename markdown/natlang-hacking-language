To come up with non-words beginning with "sex" consisting of an "s"
followed by a real word, in bash:

    < ~/devel/wordlist cat | while read freq word
        do case "$word" in
        ex*) echo "s$word";;
        esac
    done | grep -vf <(< ~/devel/wordlist head -15000
                      | while read freq word
                        do echo "^$word\$" done) | head -45 | sort

This is probably the wrong way to do it.  I thought it might be easier
in Python, but it isn't:

    import itertools
    words = [line.split()[1] for line in open('/home/user/devel/wordlist')]
    common_words = set(words[:15000])
    swords = ('s' + word for word in words if word.startswith('ex'))
    sorted(itertools.islice((sword for sword in swords if sword not in common_words), 0, 45))

Python’s set type, lazy generator expressions, and implicit file-line
iteration are useful here, but this still ends up being kind of a lot
of code, even more than the bash version, in part because genexes are
pretty pointful, which is in part because Python’s methods are not
very useful to pass to higher-order expressions like `map` and
`filter`.

Another thing to keep in mind here is that I invariably write this
kind of thing incrementally, looking at the results computed by
intermediate versions, in order to decide what to do next.  For
example, I added the filter to eliminate existing common words when
“sexist” showed up in the output, and increased the cutoff from 2000
to 15000 when it continued to show up.  Traditional
`function(arguments)` syntax kind of sucks for this, because usually
you write the arguments left to right (not least because the cursor’s
implicit motion is to the right as you type), and then you have to
move back to the beginning to add the `function` bit.  This gets even
worse when we’re wrapping something in a list comprehension or a
generator expression.

The ideal environment for writing stuff like this incrementally would
not be implicitly imperative, so that it could safely evaluate
intermediate expressions without fear of damage and evaluate lazily
for responsiveness without fear of confusion; it would allow you to
add functions on the right; it would use map and filter functions
rather than list comprehensions or generator expressions; it would use
CLOS-like generic functions, with ML-like implicit currying, instead
of methods so that you could use them as map and filter arguments; and
it would allow you to write the equivalent of `f(a, g(b, h(c, d)))`
without matching parens.

These requirements actually make it sound a lot like Forth!  But I
don’t think we need to descend down the rabbit hole of typelessness
and syntaxlessness to get these advantages.

Here’s a hack at an alternative syntax that maximizes left-to-right
typability with incremental feedback:

    '/home/user/devel/wordlist' file, split each; 1 th each -> words
    words, 'ex' startswith only;
        ('s' ++) each;
        , (words, :15000 th set) contains not each;
        :45 th sorted

I’m not sure that's right or even parseable, but here are the things I
was trying:

- `f(a, b, c)` is written as `a, b, c f`
- `x = a` is written as `a -> x`.
- `f(a, g(b, h(c, d)))` is written, with syntax somewhat borrowed from
  Mark Lentczner’s [Glyphic Script][0], which in turn borrowed it with
  a semantic change from Smalltalk, as `c, d h; b g; a f`.  I'm not
  sure that I have the parsing rules down correctly, and it might be
  better to use `c, d h | b g | a f`.  Also I think both of these do
  the wrong thing as you type the `c, d h; b` part, because it tries
  to apply `b` to the results of `h`, though `b` will become merely an
  argument to `g`; this will result in misleading feedback in the
  middle.  (The `;,` thing in the middle there makes me think that
  this is really wrong and I need to rethink it.)
- For cases where the `,,;,,;` nesting-free syntax is inadequate
  (because you need nesting in some parameter that isn’t the first
  one) 
- `map` is called `each`.  Probably it would be better to default to
  `flatMap`, but this code is written with the opposite assumption.
- Sequence indexing `[]` is spelled `th` (as in `4 th`, `5 th`, etc.),
  and sequences are lazy by default.  This may not be the best
  spelling.
- `:` is an infix operator with the same semantics as in Python
  slicing, except for indexes from the end: it returns a slice object
  that can be used with `th`.
- Functions are implicitly curried, making it easy to write functions
  like `1 th each`, which means λx.each(λy.th 1 y)x in the λ-calculus.
- There are no functions as separate from methods.  If we need ad-hoc
  polymorphism, as for `th` and sequence iteration, we use CLOS-style
  generic functions.
- `++` is the sequence concatenation function as an infix operator, in
  order to avoid semantic confusion with the `+` operator for numeric
  addition, which probably ought to be implicitly lifted to apply over
  conformable functions and sequences.  I thought about using OCaml
  `^`, SQL `||`, Perl/PHP `.`, or Lua `..`, but all of those already
  carry far too much semantic baggage already.
- `(x op)`, where `op` is an infix operator, is a Haskell-style
  “section”, meaning λy.x op y.
- `not` is implicitly lifted to operate over not just booleans but
  boolean-returning functions.
- `open` is called `file` and implicitly opens read-only, as in Python
  2.  Probably opening a file for write should use some kind of IO
  monad or whatever.
- `in` is called `contains`, on the theory that `common_words
  contains` is a sensible phrase with the right meaning.
- `split` takes a string and optionally a separator.  I need to figure
  out how to reconcile implicit currying with optional arguments, but
  I suspect OCaml labeled arguments have my back, and I don’t even
  have to use their shitty syntax because I’m not backwards-compatible
  with ML.
- `filter` is called `only`, so that `words, 'ex' startswith only`
  returns the items from `words` that start with 'ex'.
- `sorted` sorts the provided sequence, which is necessarily eager
  (the last input item might be the first output) but because of lazy
  evaluation, this only needs to loop until the first 45 items are
  generated.

The above suggests that it actually is necessary to have some kind of
separator between a function and its arguments; in this line

    '/home/user/devel/wordlist' file, split each; 1 th each

it’s totally ridiculous that `each` is being applied not only to
`split` but to the return of `file`.  We could use `.` to apply
functions and call methods:

    '/home/user/devel/wordlist'.file, split. each, 1.th. each -> words
    words, ('ex'.startswith). only, ('s' ++). each,
        (words, :15000.th. set. contains. not). each.
        :45.th.sorted

Or alternatively we could use `;`, but that’s kind of terrible,
really, because the whole point of `;` is that its left and right
precedence are very different:

    '/home/user/devel/wordlist'; file, split; each, 1;th; each -> words
    words, ('ex'; startswith); only, ('s' ++); each;
        (words, :15000;th; set; contains; not); each;
        :45;th;sorted
