Dercuano
========

I have a few thousand pages of notes I mostly haven’t published in any
form, and I’m not confident I’ll be able to keep a server running to
serve them up.  So Dercuano (a mutated version of the Spanish word
“cuaderno”, “notebook”) is a quick system I hacked together to bundle
them up into an archive of pregenerated HTML, which anyone who has a
copy can unpack and read, without requiring any online resources.

I wrote it in Python 2, even though it’s 2019, for reasons of
expediency.  I still have a wider selection of Python 2 modules
installed on this machine.
