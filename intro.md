Dercuano is a self-contained downloadable HTML tarball containing a
book’s worth of disorganized notes I’ve made over the last few years.
Buried among the errors, red herrings, and ratholes, there
are numerous wonderful insights (perhaps even a few of them original),
many fascinating facts about the world (many of which are true, and a
few of which are original observations), and a wide variety of
inventive ideas about what is possible and what could be done, in
particular ideas about how to improve the world with new hardware and
software — a few of them workable.  I’ve published little of it
previously.

Disclaimer, preface, and warning
--------------------------------

Mostly, I made
these notes for myself, though with the intention of someday getting
most of them into shape for publication, but lacking the discipline imposed by
regular publication, that’s probably not going to happen.  It may not
happen anyway.  So, fuck it!  Here it is, incomplete as it is — I hope
you enjoy it!

### Beware, this is (almost) all wrong ###

Much of what is written here is wrong in a variety of ways.

- Some of it is factually wrong;
- some of it was factually correct at one point but has since become outdated;
- some of it is okay at a factual level but has led me to incorrect
  conclusions due to my misunderstanding of the relationships between
  the facts;
- some of it is just a farrago of incoherent sentence fragments;
- some of it is a collection of atomic facts that are individually
  coherent and could, in theory, be assembled into a meaningful whole,
  but so far have not been;
- some of it documents the embarrassingly long path of reasoning by
  which I eventually argued myself around to a reasonable conclusion
  which was, in retrospect, obvious from the start; and
- some of it, perhaps most of it, amounts to getting distracted from
  the most important aspects of an issue by some minor detail.

On the other hand, some of it is correct.  Of the correct part, most
is unoriginal — sometimes I’m just taking notes on well-established
concepts, and sometimes I’m laboriously rediscovering things that are
already obvious to others — while some small part is original.
Unfortunately, I don’t know which part.

Most of these notes are about things I barely understood, or
didn’t really understand at all, when I wrote the notes.  In some
cases, I later came to understand them better, but in other cases I’ve
lost even what understanding I had.  Nearly every note is incomplete;
of those that are complete, very few have been checked for correctness
or revised for readability.  So, beware.

Many of the dates are only approximate.

### Size and public-domain dedication ###

On 2019-05-27 as I write this, the Dercuano tarball is 2.6 megabytes
and contains some 890,000 words in 621 notes,
about 3100 paperback pages’
worth of text.  This is about two thirds of the total amount
of text I have here and intend to include.  I’m still importing notes
to add to it.

As far as I’m concerned, everyone is free to redistribute Dercuano, in
whole or in part, modified or unmodified, with or without credit; I
waive all rights associated with it to the maximum extent possible
under applicable law.  Where applicable, I abandon its copyright to
the public domain.  I wrote and published Dercuano in Argentina.

The exception to the above public-domain dedication is the ET Book
font family used, licensed under [the X11
license](liabilities/LICENSE.ETBook).  This doesn’t impede you from
redistributing or modifying Dercuano but does prohibit you from
removing the font’s copyright notice and license (unless you also
remove the font).
